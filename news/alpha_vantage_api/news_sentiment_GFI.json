Orford believes its south gold zone at Joutel Eagle currently being drilled has great potential and high grade gold targets at Qiqavik are very prospective. We are eager to execute the program outlined for the West Raglan high grade Nickel Copper Platinum Group metals project. We are very eager to see the 2022 results from both our gold target drilling and nickel target drilling\".",

GEO sales growth was driven by an increased contribution from Cobre Panama, outperformance by Antamina and contributions from new acquisitions. The advantage of our diverse portfolio was again demonstrated in 2021. High iron ore prices during the year boosted revenues from our iron ore holdings and rising energy prices resulted in our energy revenues more than doubling. Following 2021's rapid GEO growth, we expect slightly lower GEOs in 2022 and then to continue our growth through 2026. With limited exposure to inflation, our top-line growth translated directly into expanded margins and record earnings. Franco-Nevada is debt-free, is growing its cash balances and has a strong pipeline of growth opportunities.\"",
