I had been asking for months where is the missing $25000. Neither company could give me a straight answer. So eventually they disbursed only $56000 of it, divided by 4 beneficiaries. \n\nToday I called Monetary Gold and got the front desk lady, self described. She said your mother “bought long-term gold and there is a 33% transaction fee.”\n\nFirst, who sells a 79 year old woman long term gold? \nSecond, why did no one ever mention this in the hundreds of conversations we had before?\n\nI asked for the contract my mom signed. I have sent to my estate attorney, but he has to be the worst working attorney in Ohio. I don’t see anything about a 33% transaction fee anywhere in the contract.\n\nThis just seems predatory.

A few months before her passing she transferred all her stock market money into gold and silver. $81,000 worth. \n\nAfter dealing with Equity Trust and Monetary Gold for 4 months, they sent out a total distribution to beneficiaries for around $54,000.

I am at a loss with these people. \n\n“ The amount that you would get back if you sold them is the market value or numismatic value and that number is typically higher.\n \nYou will need to reach out to your precious metals dealer to find out what that value is.\n \nPlease see below information from our legal team:\n\nEquity Trust provides an indication value, based on the metal type held in your account.\nThe value is received daily from third-party sources that are also used by the depository that stores your metals.\nThis value is referred to as the spot price and is also sometimes referred to as the melt value.\nSpot price/melt value only considers the type of metals held and the total weight.\nPlease keep in mind that the spot price/melt value may not represent the value received if you sell the precious metals in the account.\nMetal sales typically are completed at market value, in other words, what a precious metals dealer is willing to pay you.\nMarket value is typically higher than Spot price/melt value.”\n\n**1/30/24 Update *** Finally, got a hold of Monetary Gold. The lady that works the front desk(!) said she had invested in long term gold and there was a 33% TRANSACTION FEE. I asked is there an exception for when a person dies? She did not know.\n\nFor months no one would answer my question about why market value did not reflect the 81k she invested. And after it is paid out, the front desk lady can answer the question. \n\nWho sells long-term metals to a 79 year old woman?

        "original_text": "              London is also the centre for gold leases – the borrowing and lending of precious metals, with bullion banks typically borrowing from central banks or other market participants and lending to quality institutions that borrow gold thus earning a spread. Borrowers include jewellery manufacturing groups, miners and ...those who are shorting the market (they borrow gold to sell it in the expectation that prices will fall, where they make a profit). But if the cost of borrowing gold goes through the roof … as it has ... then that trade can get deeply unattractive and expensive very quickly. \n\nInter-bank gold lease rates are typically sub 0.5% while market counterparts could pay between 1% to 3% pa depending upon credit worthiness. Well interbank borrowing costs for 1 to 3 months perioods recently rose to a peak of about 12%. That hurts. \n\nSo that's what we have today … and that takes us back to New York. Speculators who have been running a leveraged short gold position are closing out these bets by buying gold because it is expensive to run (and likely taking a loss) … and hence the price rally. Everything is connected. \n\nWe estimate that so far 280 tonnes of gold has been flown from London to New York in the last month – so between 50 to 60 flights will have been carrying the metal into CME registered vaults to fill the demand. If no tariffs, then likely that metal will come home to London over the next few months. It's once again time to start sharing the good news about gold .

Verifying documentation like Intent Letters and proof of funds can go a long way in ensuring secure transactions.\n2. **Gold Specifications to Know:** High-quality gold bullion typically comes in 22, 23, or 24 karats with a fineness of 96%-97%. Knowing these details helps you understand what you’re buying or selling.\n3. **Transparency in Pricing:** In bulk transactions, competitive pricing is common, with large deals often negotiated at rates below market value. It’s important to stay informed about current market rates and pricing structures.\n4. **Shipping and Logistics:** Shipping gold involves significant logistical challenges. Make sure you understand the taxation rules in your country, as this can affect where and how the gold is shipped.\n\nI’m curious to hear how others in this community navigate the complexities of gold transactions. What processes or best practices do you rely on to ensure a safe and secure experience?\n\nLet’s share knowledge and make gold trading safer for everyone!",

It’s helped me feel more confident in negotiations—but I’d love to hear real-world perspectives before I go too deep into the AI side of things.\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n1. Do you have any rule-of-thumb for spotting overpriced pieces?\n2. Have you ever walked away from a deal because of a suspected markup?\n3.

I recently started getting into investing, and I’m currently putting about €100 a month into the stock market by placing small orders. However, I’d also like to diversify my investments and start investing in gold.\n\nWith my current budget, I’m thinking of starting small by putting around €100 a month into gold. I know it’s not a lot, but I think it’s a good idea to invest in small amounts (like 1g, whether it’s bars or coins). Over time, as I can work during the summer or earn a more stable income, I hope to increase my budget for both the stock market and gold.

From ancient civilizations to modern religious practices, gold has held a unique place in the hearts of many. But why is it that this metal, with its radiant shine and rarity, has been so deeply associated with spirituality and sacredness across cultures? Let’s dive into the fascinating reasons behind gold's sacred status.\n\n# Gold’s Physical Properties: The \"Perfect\" Metal\n\nOne of the key reasons gold has been so highly regarded is its inherent qualities. Gold doesn’t tarnish, rust, or lose its shine over time. This durability made it the perfect metaphor for the divine in many ancient cultures. Gods and deities were often depicted with golden symbols, crowns, or even bodies, as gold's permanence was seen as a reflection of their eternal nature. The ancient Egyptians, for instance, were known to bury their pharaohs with gold to ensure their safe journey to the afterlife.\n\nFor early humans, the simple fact that gold didn’t fade away like other metals likely created a sense of mystery and reverence. This was a material that seemed untouched by time, just as gods were believed to be. In Hinduism, for example, gold is frequently used in the creation of idols and religious ornaments, representing purity and an unchanging essence.\n\n# Gold as a Symbol of Wealth and Power\n\nIn many religions, gold is also linked to concepts of divine favor and divine power. The idea that gold was rare and expensive contributed to its association with wealth, which in turn was seen as a blessing from the gods. In the Christian tradition, the \"three wise men\" are said to have brought gold to the newborn Jesus, symbolizing his royal status and divine nature. Similarly, in Buddhism, golden statues of the Buddha are used to signify his spiritual and material prosperity.\n\nThis association of gold with power and wealth made it the ideal material for temples, altars, and religious artifacts. It's no coincidence that the Vatican and other major religious institutions have large amounts of gold in their treasures—it is a material that communicates importance and divine sanction.\n\n# Gold and the Sun: A Divine Connection\n\nIn many ancient religions, gold was linked to the sun, the source of life and energy. The bright, radiant glow of gold was seen as a reflection of the sun's power. In ancient Egyptian religion, the sun god Ra was often depicted wearing a golden disc, symbolizing the sun's eternal cycle of life and renewal. In Greek mythology, the gods were often associated with gold, such as the golden apples of the Hesperides, which were believed to grant immortality.\n\nThis connection to the sun made gold a fitting material for religious symbolism. Just as the sun was seen as a giver of life, gold became a symbol of divine energy and everlasting vitality.\n\n# Gold in Contemporary Religious Practices\n\nEven today, gold continues to play a significant role in religious ceremonies and practices. In Hinduism, for instance, gold is often used in wedding rituals, as it symbolizes prosperity and an unbreakable bond between husband and wife. Likewise, gold coins are frequently used in offerings during religious festivals to honor deities and seek blessings for wealth and good fortune.\n\nIn Christianity, gold remains an important part of religious iconography, especially during Christmas and Easter celebrations. The golden chalice used in communion, for example, signifies the purity and sanctity of Christ’s blood. Similarly, the gilded altars and crosses in many churches are meant to evoke the presence of God’s glory and majesty.\n\n# Gold as a Representation of Purity and Divinity\n\nGold’s purity is another reason it has been regarded as sacred in many religions. When pure, gold doesn’t mix with other elements, which made it the perfect representation of divine purity. In many religious traditions, gold was used in sacred rituals to sanctify and purify. In Judaism, the Ark of the Covenant was constructed with gold, symbolizing God’s holiness and the sacredness of His covenant with His people.\n\nIn Buddhism, gold leaf is often applied to statues of the Buddha as a way of offering something of value to the divine. The act of gilding is a gesture of devotion, symbolizing the desire to purify the mind and soul. Gold’s unblemished shine represents spiritual clarity and the pursuit of enlightenment.\n\n# Gold as a Modern Symbol of Spiritual Wealth\n\nInterestingly, as much as gold is revered for its spiritual qualities, it is also one of the most commonly bought and sold commodities in the world. If you’re looking to part with your gold, you might wonder, “Where can I find trustworthy [gold buyers](https://benakagoldcompany.com/) near me?” It’s not uncommon for people to seek out these buyers in times of financial need or as a way to liquidate old or unused gold.\n\nIn conclusion, gold’s sacredness in religion is rooted in its unique physical properties, historical associations with wealth and power, connections to the sun, and its purity. Whether you’re looking to [sell gold near me ](https://sellgoldnearme.co.in/)or seeking ways to pass down your family heirlooms, it’s clear that gold holds far more value than just its market price. It remains a symbol of the divine, the eternal, and the unchanging—a material that has always carried a sacred power, bridging the material world with the spiritual.\n\nIf you ever decide to part with your gold treasures, it’s worth considering how the value of this metal can go beyond its weight. After all, for millennia, it’s been a symbol of something far greater than just currency—something that connects us to the divine.",

In 2025, as markets face new challenges and uncertainties, buying gold continues to be seen as a safe haven for investors looking to preserve their wealth. But why does gold still hold such a prominent place in modern-day investment strategies? This blog explores why investing in gold is still a wise decision in 2025, looking at its history, current trends, and why it's considered a reliable asset for the future.\n\n# 1. Gold as a Hedge Against Inflation\n\nOne of the primary reasons gold remains a wise investment choice in 2025 is its ability to act as a hedge against inflation. As central banks around the world continue to print money and governments accumulate debt, inflation risks are ever-present. When inflation rises, the purchasing power of traditional currencies tends to decrease, but gold has historically maintained its value.\n\nIn times of inflationary pressures, the price of gold typically rises because it is perceived as a store of value. Gold’s ability to preserve wealth when fiat currencies are losing value is a key reason why it remains an attractive option for investors looking for stability.\n\n# 2. Diversification and Portfolio Protection\n\nGold is an excellent tool for portfolio diversification. In investment terms, diversification refers to spreading investments across different asset classes to reduce risk. While stocks and bonds can be volatile, gold tends to have a low correlation with traditional assets, meaning it often performs well when other markets are struggling.\n\nIn uncertain times, like market crashes or geopolitical instability, gold tends to outperform other investments. For investors looking to protect their portfolios against unpredictable market conditions in 2025, adding gold as part of a diversified investment strategy can provide the stability needed to weather volatility.\n\n# 3. Gold as a Safe Haven During Times of Crisis\n\nThroughout history, gold has proven to be a safe haven during periods of political or economic crisis. From the 2008 financial crisis to the COVID-19 pandemic, gold has consistently increased in value when investors are nervous about the stability of the stock market, the economy, or the global political landscape.\n\nIn 2025, with growing concerns about inflation, rising geopolitical tensions, and potential financial instability in certain regions, investors are turning to gold as a means of preserving wealth and reducing risk. Even in a world filled with economic uncertainty, gold remains a reliable and tangible asset that investors can rely on during times of crisis.\n\n# 4. Gold’s Long-Term Value Preservation\n\nGold has proven itself as a store of value for thousands of years. Unlike paper currencies, which can lose their value due to inflation, government policies, or market fluctuations, gold has maintained its purchasing power over time. For those looking to build wealth over the long term, gold is an asset that doesn’t lose its value—its historical significance and rarity ensure that it will always have intrinsic worth.\n\nIn 2025, buying gold remains a strategy that many long-term investors rely on. Whether in the form of **gold bullion**, **gold coins**, or **gold-backed ETFs**, gold is a way to secure wealth for future generations, providing a legacy of financial stability.\n\n# 5. The Role of Gold in Modern Markets\n\nThe global market for gold is also evolving. The introduction of **gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs)** has made it easier than ever for investors to gain exposure to gold without the need to physically hold the metal. This convenience, combined with a growing interest in digital gold and blockchain-based gold platforms, is making gold more accessible to a broader range of investors, from individuals to institutional players.\n\nAdditionally, countries like China and Russia are increasing their gold reserves, further solidifying the role of gold in global markets. This growing demand for gold as a central bank reserve asset adds to its reputation as a stable and secure investment.\n\n# 6. Why Buying Gold is Still Accessible in 2025\n\nIn 2025, buying gold has become more accessible than ever. Traditional methods, like visiting a [gold buyer ](https://benakagoldcompany.com/)or purchasing gold coins from reputable dealers, are still popular. However, with the advent of online platforms and digital gold services, investors can now buy gold from the comfort of their homes. Whether you are looking for physical gold or prefer the convenience of digital gold, there are more options than ever for purchasing this precious metal.\n\nFor those in local communities, if you're considering **selling gold near me**, finding reputable gold dealers is crucial. With the right gold buyer, you can ensure that you get a fair price for your gold. Reputable gold buyers not only offer competitive rates but also provide expert advice on how to sell or buy gold in various forms, ensuring a smooth transaction every time.\n\n# 7. Gold’s Role in Geopolitical Stability\n\nGold is also an important asset when it comes to geopolitical stability. Nations that maintain large gold reserves are often seen as being more economically stable, and gold can serve as a financial buffer against the volatility caused by political unrest or global economic disruptions. In 2025, with ongoing uncertainties surrounding trade wars, regional conflicts, and shifts in global power dynamics, gold continues to serve as an important asset for both governments and individual investors.\n\n# 8. Sustainability and Gold Mining\n\nAnother factor contributing to gold’s enduring appeal in 2025 is the increasing emphasis on **sustainable mining practices**. As the world becomes more conscious of environmental impacts, many gold mining companies are adopting greener technologies and practices to minimize their carbon footprint. Investing in companies that prioritize sustainability within the gold sector ensures that investors can grow their wealth while supporting ethical practices in the industry.\n\n# Conclusion: A Timeless Investment Choice\n\nIn conclusion, gold remains an attractive investment in 2025 for many reasons. From its ability to hedge against inflation and protect against economic uncertainty to its role in diversifying portfolios, gold’s stability and long-term value make it a smart choice for investors. Whether you're looking to buy physical gold or digital assets, the world of gold investing offers numerous opportunities to secure wealth and build financial security.\n\nFor those interested in exploring gold further, it’s important to connect with **gold buyers** who can help guide your investment journey, ensuring you make informed decisions.

Whether it’s a piece you wear every day or a cherished heirloom passed down through generations, keeping your gold jewelry looking shiny and new is essential. Proper care and maintenance can help preserve the beauty and value of your gold pieces for many years to come.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll share some simple yet effective tips on how to take care of your gold jewelry, ensuring that it stays in pristine condition.\n\n# Store Your Gold Jewelry Properly\n\nHow you store your gold jewelry can make a big difference in its condition over time. Gold is a relatively soft metal, which means it can be easily scratched or damaged if not stored correctly. Here are a few tips for safe storage:\n\n* **Use a Jewelry Box:** Store your gold jewelry in a soft-lined jewelry box. This will prevent scratches from occurring when pieces rub against each other.\n* **Separate Pieces:** Avoid piling multiple pieces of gold jewelry together. It’s a good idea to keep each piece in its own compartment or pouch to avoid friction and scratching.\n* **Avoid Humidity and Heat:** Excessive humidity or heat can cause gold to tarnish or lose its shine. Store your jewelry in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.\n\n# Clean Your Gold Jewelry Regularly\n\nTo keep your gold jewelry looking its best, regular cleaning is a must. Over time, dirt, oils from your skin, and environmental pollutants can accumulate on the surface, dulling the shine. Here’s how to clean your gold jewelry effectively:\n\n* **Soak in Soapy Water:** A gentle solution of warm water and mild dish soap is usually enough to clean most gold jewelry. Soak your pieces for 10-15 minutes, then use a soft brush (like a toothbrush) to gently scrub any dirt or grime from hard-to-reach areas, such as the clasps or intricate designs.\n* **Rinse and Dry:** After soaking and scrubbing, rinse your jewelry thoroughly with clean water and pat it dry with a soft, lint-free cloth.\n* **Polish Regularly:** Use a jewelry polishing cloth specifically designed for gold to bring back its natural shine. These cloths are impregnated with a gentle cleaning solution that helps remove tarnish and restore the gold’s gleam.\n\n# Avoid Wearing Gold Jewelry in Certain Situations\n\nWhile gold is durable, it can be affected by harsh chemicals and extreme conditions. To protect your jewelry from unnecessary wear, take it off in the following situations:\n\n* **Swimming Pools and Hot Tubs:** Chlorine and other chemicals in swimming pools can damage gold, causing discoloration or weakening the metal. Always remove your jewelry before swimming.\n* **Household Cleaning:** Cleaning products like bleach, ammonia, or harsh detergents can tarnish or even discolor gold. Always remove your jewelry before doing household chores.\n* **Exercise and Sports:** If you’re engaging in physical activities, such as exercising, gardening, or playing sports, it’s a good idea to take off your gold jewelry. Sweat, dirt, and friction can cause damage over time.\n\n# Take Care When Applying Cosmetics or Perfume\n\nGold jewelry is sensitive to chemicals, and the lotions, perfumes, and cosmetics we use daily can cause a gradual build-up of residue on the surface of your jewelry. To avoid this:\n\n* **Apply Cosmetics First:** Always put on your cosmetics and perfume before wearing your gold jewelry. Allow lotions, perfumes, or hair products to dry before putting on your jewelry.\n* **Wipe Off Excess Oils:** If you’ve accidentally applied lotions or oils while wearing jewelry, gently wipe it off with a soft cloth to prevent any build-up that could dull the gold’s shine.\n\n# Get Your Gold Jewelry Professionally Cleaned and Inspected\n\nWhile regular cleaning at home is important, it’s also a good idea to have your gold jewelry professionally cleaned and inspected by a jeweler from time to time. Professional jewelers can:\n\n* **Deep Clean Your Jewelry:** They have access to specialized tools and cleaning solutions that can restore your jewelry to its original luster.\n* **Inspect for Damage:** A jeweler will carefully check for loose stones, clasps, or other issues that may require repair. This ensures your pieces are safe to wear and that any problems are addressed before they get worse.\n\n# Know When to Sell Your Gold\n\nSometimes, despite all the care you give your gold jewelry, it may no longer be in the best condition, or you might simply outgrow it. In these cases, selling your gold can be a great option.\n\nIf you're looking to [sell gold near me](https://sellgoldnearme.co.in/), there are plenty of trusted [gold buyers](https://benakagoldcompany.com/) who will offer competitive prices for your pieces, especially if they are no longer in use. Whether you're clearing out old jewelry or upgrading your collection, selling your gold can be a quick way to make some extra cash.\n\nWhen selling gold, always make sure to choose a reputable buyer. A trustworthy **gold buyer** will assess the purity and weight of your gold accurately and offer a fair price based on current market rates. Keep in mind that gold prices fluctuate, so it’s a good idea to get a few quotes from different buyers before making a decision.\n\n# Consider Insurance for Valuable Pieces\n\nIf you have particularly valuable gold jewelry, consider insuring it to protect against loss, theft, or damage. Insurance can give you peace of mind, knowing that if something were to happen to your jewelry, you would be compensated.\n\nGold jewelry insurance is typically available through homeowner’s insurance or specialized jewelry insurance policies. Be sure to have your jewelry appraised and documented before obtaining insurance, so you have an accurate record of its value.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nGold jewelry is an investment in both beauty and value, and with proper care, it can last for generations. By following these simple tips—storing it correctly, cleaning it regularly, avoiding harsh chemicals, and knowing when to sell—you can ensure that your gold jewelry stays shiny and new for years to come. And if you ever decide it’s time to part with a piece, there are plenty of **gold buyers** around who can help you get the best value for your items. Taking care of your gold jewelry is a small investment in its longevity, making it a piece that can continue to shine, both literally and financially, well into the future.\n\nThis blog has been drafted by - [Benaka Gold Company](https://benakagoldcompany.com/).",

I asked her a lot or questions, but the most important one for me what how did she get started?\n\nShe said that for her first batch of clients, to get some knowledge on selling, build some sort of credibility and to get to know the sales side of it, she sold her first few watches at a loss, or at break even.\n\nThe clients were happy, and in return she got some valuable connections.\n\nWith that being said, what are your thoughts on selling gold online? \n\nI was thinking of doing the same thing for maybe the first 5-10 orders? Maybe the first 5, sell it  below cost, so I learn how to send it properly and with protection, and also maybe the clients a bit happy with below market value of gold? Next 5 will be at cost, and after that bring cost to appropriate prices?\n\nMy concern is that to spend money on gold without knowing me is an issue and I don't know if I'll find people that will trust me.

When interest rates are raised then less borrowing/spending happens and it's deflationary.\n\n2. If less gets spent, then the prices fall incl. the stock market.\n\n3. If stock market is falling, people invest more into gold as a hedge/safe store of value, so despite being in a deflationary state/depression the price of gold tends to rise.\n\n4. Gold keeps up, to some extent, with inflation (so does the stock market), but gold also tends to rise when the stocks market is doing bad, at least until the stock market starts recovering, then people sell gold and get back into the stock market and gold might/should have a dip in value.\n\n5.

A few months before her passing she transferred all her stock market money into gold and silver. $81,000 worth. \n\nAfter dealing with Equity Trust and Monetary Gold for 4 months, they sent out a total distribution to beneficiaries for around $54,000. So i ask them , where is the difference? I know that gold and silver has not dropped dramatically. \nThere response is below. Can anyone explain this in Layman’s terms for me? I am at a loss with these people. \n\n“ The amount that you would get back if you sold them is the market value or numismatic value and that number is typically higher.\n \nYou will need to reach out to your precious metals dealer to find out what that value is.\n \nPlease see below information from our legal team:\n\nEquity Trust provides an indication value, based on the metal type held in your account.\nThe value is received daily from third-party sources that are also used by the depository that stores your metals.\nThis value is referred to as the spot price and is also sometimes referred to as the melt value.\nSpot price/melt value only considers the type of metals held and the total weight.\nPlease keep in mind that the spot price/melt value may not represent the value received if you sell the precious metals in the account.\nMetal sales typically are completed at market value, in other words, what a precious metals dealer is willing to pay you.\nMarket value is typically higher than Spot price/melt value.”\n\n**1/30/24 Update *** Finally, got a hold of Monetary Gold. The lady that works the front desk(!) said she had invested in long term gold and there was a 33% TRANSACTION FEE. I asked is there an exception for when a person dies? She did not know.\n\nFor months no one would answer my question about why market value did not reflect the 81k she invested. And after it is paid out, the front desk lady can answer the question. \n\nWho sells long-term metals to a 79 year old woman?

These bonds track the market value of gold and offer an **annual interest rate of 2.5%.**\n2. **Gold ETFs and Gold Mutual Funds:** If you prefer investing digitally, Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and gold mutual funds are worth exploring.

I am thinking of stacking these for now, aiming to buy at least 1 per year (hopefully more if income allows) and keeping them as a long term investment. I wanted some advice please on what you would do in this scenario. Apologies if any of my terminology is incorrect:\n1. Am I right to go for the 1oz Gold Bar? I have read that there are higher premiums on smaller amounts so 1oz is like a good minimum weight\n2. Does the type of gold bar matter? I heard good things about PAMP for eg but if I am keeping them for at least 5-10 years, will that brand still be popular? Or should I not care about brand unless I am trying to flip them (which is far too intimidating for me right now 😅)\n3. Anything against the cast type or should I pay more for the minted?\n4. Since I am in the UK, should that influence where/what type I should buy? I heard some negative things about royal mint and good things about Australian, but since I am in the U.K. is it best to stick to my own country?\n5.

        "original_text": "So I see this alot and run into this even more. Maybe those with more knowledge can expand on this topic, for old times sake. \n\nThe price of gold jewelry vs investment-type gold. \n\n\"The chain is 14k and weighs 12 grams, and costs [so much money over spot]. That's a rip off.\" \n\nWithin reason, yes, there is definitely some pieces that would fall into this category. But you cannot base your ripoff meter on the spot price alone. You have to do your research on the costs of similar items to determine \"ripoff\" potential.\n\nFor example, let's say that this fictional chain, 12 grams, 14k, costs 500% over spot price per gram. I know, I know, your ripoff meter is going off right now lol and you walk away from the deal but the guy behind you buys it outright, no negotiations.\n\nWhat happened??? Oh, you didn't realize that the chain was not only a vintage, but it was also from Cartier...just an example of why I feel its not good to judge a piece of jewelry by its weight. \n\nOr here is a more common example, an engagement ring. If any of yall have ever been in that process, once the girl sees the ring she has envisioned all of her life, the price per gram, the premium, all that mess, goes out the door. \"Babe, that's a ripoff, it only weighs 5 grams of 14k gold,\" good luck with that, you just shattered your fiancé 's perfect ring dream. \n\nAnyways, just trying to make a point. If the chain is costing on average the same amount as other competitors, boys and girls, it's not a ripoff, it's supply and demand. And if you go into buying a piece of jewelry with bullion prices in mind, you may need to check that outside the door, or just drill a hole on a gold buffalo, tie a shoe string through it, and wear it. Now that there my friends, is investment-type jewelry.\n\nLets get into it. Also, let's be respectful as well, hoping for some meaningful conversation 🙏",

I recently started getting into investing, and I’m currently putting about €100 a month into the stock market by placing small orders. However, I’d also like to diversify my investments and start investing in gold.\n\nWith my current budget, I’m thinking of starting small by putting around €100 a month into gold. I know it’s not a lot, but I think it’s a good idea to invest in small amounts (like 1g, whether it’s bars or coins). Over time, as I can work during the summer or earn a more stable income, I hope to increase my budget for both the stock market and gold. I believe that over the long term, this could create a snowball effect.\n\nWhat are the best coins for someone with my budget? I’ve heard that Napoleons are popular, but are there other options I should consider?\n\nShould I focus on coins or small gold bars, and why?\n\nAre there things I should prioritize or avoid (e.g., certain types of coins, specific sellers, etc.)?\n\nAny advice on where to buy gold safely and with reasonable fees, especially for small amounts like mine?\n\n\nI’m looking to build something for the long term, so any advice or tips that could help me avoid beginner mistakes would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for your help and suggestions!",

Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have massive war chests to outspend competitors. Nvidia alone spent nearly $9 billion on R&D in 2024 and can quickly adapt to new threats by enhancing its offerings or lowering costs if necessary.\n\n2. Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about hardware—it’s deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.\n\n3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. \n\n4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.\n\nCritiques tend to fall into two camps…\n\n1. Nvidias margins are going to be eroded \n\nTo this I think we have to acknowledge that while lower margins and demand would impact the stock both of these are speculative. \n\nIncreased efficiency typically increases demand. And Nvidias customers are pretty entrenched, it’s def not certain they will bleed customers. \n\nOn top of that Nvidia’s profitability isn’t solely tied to selling GPUs. Its software stack (e.g., CUDA), enterprise services, and licensing deals contribute significantly. These high-margin revenue streams I would guess are going to remain solid even if hardware pricing pressures increase.\n\n2. Open source has a number of relative advantages\n\nI think open source is heavily favorited by startups and indie developers (Open source is strongly favored by Reddit specifically). But the enterprise buyer doesn’t typically lean this way.\n\nOpen-source solutions require significant internal expertise for implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Large enterprises often prefer Nvidia’s support and commercial-grade stack because they get a dedicated team for ongoing updates, security patches, and scalability.",

        "original_text": "Understanding monetary liquidity is key to unpacking risk-assets. \n\nUnderstanding the mechanics of monetary systems requires unpacking the interplay between central banks, commercial banks, financial markets, and the broader economy. At its core, the Federal Reserve (Fed) operates as the cornerstone of the U.S. monetary system, managing the supply of money and credit to achieve its dual mandate: price stability and full employment. To comprehend this system, we’ll explore the Fed’s balance sheet, its tools, and how these influence the economy.\n\n# 1. The Federal Reserve Balance Sheet\n\nThe Fed’s balance sheet consists of assets and liabilities, which interact to shape liquidity and monetary conditions in the economy:\n\n# Assets\n\n1. **U.S. Treasuries**:\n   * Treasury securities (bills, notes, and bonds) are the largest asset class on the Fed’s balance sheet. They represent loans to the federal government and are considered virtually risk-free.\n   * The Fed purchases Treasuries during open market operations to inject liquidity into the financial system. These purchases lower yields, reducing borrowing costs across the economy and encouraging investment.\n   * Conversely, selling Treasuries reduces liquidity and raises yields, acting as a tightening measure.\n2. **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**:\n   * Acquired during quantitative easing (QE) programs, MBS purchases aim to stabilize the housing market by lowering mortgage rates.\n   * The Fed’s involvement in the MBS market creates demand, which supports liquidity for banks and other institutions issuing these securities.\n3. **Loans to Financial Institutions**:\n   * Includes discount window loans and emergency lending facilities. These loans provide short-term funding to banks facing liquidity crises, ensuring stability in the financial system.\n   * During financial crises, such as in 2008 or 2020, these facilities act as a critical backstop to prevent systemic collapse.\n4. **Other Assets**:\n   * This category includes foreign currency reserves, gold certificates, and various liquidity facilities established during times of stress, such as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).\n\n# Liabilities\n\n1. **Reserve Balances**:\n   * Reserves are deposits held by commercial banks at the Fed. These reserves play a central role in monetary policy as they determine the amount of liquidity in the banking system.\n   * Excess reserves, beyond what banks are required to hold, can be lent out, influencing credit creation and economic activity.\n2. **Currency in Circulation**:\n   * Physical cash held by the public and financial institutions. This is the most visible component of the money supply but represents only a fraction of total liquidity.\n3. **Treasury General Account (TGA)**:\n   * The U.S. Treasury’s account at the Fed. It acts as the government’s checking account, with inflows from tax revenues and debt issuance and outflows for spending programs.\n   * Changes in the TGA have a direct impact on reserves in the banking system, affecting liquidity.\n   * **TGA Interactions with Reserves**:\n      * When the Treasury spends (TGA drawdown), funds flow into the banking system, increasing bank reserves and liquidity. For example, payments for infrastructure projects deposit money into contractor accounts at commercial banks, raising reserve balances.\n      * Conversely, when the Treasury issues debt and deposits proceeds into the TGA (TGA build-up), reserves are drained from the banking system as banks and other institutions purchase Treasury securities, reducing liquidity. This process effectively tightens financial conditions.\n      * Large swings in the TGA balance can create volatility in reserve levels, forcing the Fed to adjust its operations to maintain stability in short-term funding markets.\n4. **Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)**:\n   * A mechanism allowing money market funds and other participants to lend cash to the Fed overnight. This temporarily reduces liquidity in the system while providing a risk-free return to lenders.\n   * **RRP Interactions with Reserves**:\n      * Funds parked in the RRP are removed from the banking system’s reserves temporarily, reducing the overall liquidity available for lending and investment. This can help the Fed manage excess reserves during periods of abundant liquidity.\n      * When funds flow out of the RRP (e.g., as MMFs chase higher yields in T-bills), reserves increase, adding liquidity back into the system. This interplay directly influences the velocity of money and the availability of credit.\n\n# 2. Key Monetary Tools and Their Mechanics\n\n# 1. Open Market Operations (OMO)\n\n* The Fed’s primary tool for managing liquidity involves buying or selling government securities in the open market.\n* **Buying Assets**: When the Fed buys Treasuries or MBS, it credits reserves to the selling bank’s account. This increases system-wide reserves and lowers interest rates by increasing the demand for these assets.\n* **Selling Assets**: When the Fed sells securities, it reduces reserves in the banking system, raising interest rates and tightening monetary conditions.\n\n# 2. Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT)\n\n* **QE**: Large-scale asset purchases by the Fed to inject liquidity into the economy. By lowering long-term interest rates, QE encourages borrowing, investment, and risk-taking.\n* **QT**: The reverse of QE, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet by allowing securities to mature or actively selling them. This drains reserves and tightens financial conditions, slowing economic activity.\n\n# 3. Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB)\n\n* The Fed pays interest on reserves held by banks. By adjusting the IORB rate, the Fed influences banks’ incentives to lend or hold reserves:\n   * **Higher IORB**: Encourages banks to hold reserves, reducing credit creation.\n   * **Lower IORB**: Promotes lending, increasing money supply and economic activity.\n\n# 4. Discount Window Lending\n\n* The Fed’s discount window provides emergency funding to banks facing short-term liquidity shortages. While rarely used under normal conditions, it’s a vital safety net during crises.\n* The availability of this facility enhances market confidence, ensuring that temporary liquidity issues don’t escalate into broader financial instability.\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)\n\n* The RRP provides a floor for short-term interest rates by offering a risk-free return for cash parked at the Fed. This tool helps the Fed maintain control over its policy rate, particularly in times of excess liquidity.\n* **Detailed RRP Mechanics**:\n   * The RRP operates by allowing money market funds, government-sponsored enterprises, and other eligible participants to invest cash with the Fed overnight. In return, participants receive a fixed interest rate.\n   * Funds placed in the RRP are effectively removed from the banking system’s reserves, reducing liquidity and high-velocity money in the economy. This dampens inflationary pressures and helps stabilize short-term interest rates.\n* **Impact of RRP Depletion**:\n   * If the RRP were emptied, participants would redirect funds into other short-term instruments like T-bills or commercial paper. This would inject liquidity back into the system, increasing bank reserves and amplifying the velocity of money.\n   * Without the RRP as a buffer, the Fed would face greater challenges in controlling short-term interest rates during periods of excess liquidity. This could lead to heightened volatility in money markets and complicate monetary policy execution.\n\n# 3. The Mechanics of Liquidity\n\n# Monetary Base vs. Money Supply\n\n* **Monetary Base (M0)**: The sum of currency in circulation and reserves held at the Fed. This forms the foundation of the money supply.\n* **Money Supply (M1, M2)**: Includes currency, demand deposits, and broader money aggregates. These reflect the multiplier effect of bank lending and public spending.\n\n# Liquidity Creation\n\n* The Fed injects reserves into the system through asset purchases or lending. Banks, in turn, use these reserves to create loans, expanding the money supply.\n* The extent of liquidity creation depends on demand for credit, regulatory constraints, and economic conditions.\n\n# Liquidity Drains\n\n* Tools like QT, RRP, and TGA operations remove liquidity by reducing reserves or diverting funds into low-velocity accounts, tightening financial conditions.\n* **Velocity of Money**:\n   * Velocity measures how quickly money circulates in the economy. High velocity indicates active economic participation and rapid money turnover, often accompanying inflationary pressures.\n   * Tools like the RRP and TGA effectively lower velocity by locking up funds in low-velocity accounts. Conversely, liquidity injections increase velocity by providing funds for spending and investment.\n\n# 4. The Treasury General Account (TGA)\n\nThe TGA functions as the government’s primary account, influencing liquidity in the financial system:\n\n* **TGA Drawdowns**: When the Treasury spends, funds flow from the TGA into the banking system. This increases bank reserves, enhancing liquidity and economic activity.\n   * For example, when the Treasury pays contractors or distributes social security benefits, the receiving entities deposit the funds in their commercial bank accounts. These deposits simultaneously increase reserve balances at the Fed.\n* **TGA Build-ups**: Conversely, when the Treasury issues debt and deposits proceeds into the TGA, reserves are drained from the banking system.\n   * The draining effect reduces the liquidity available for banks to lend and invest, tightening financial conditions. This interaction is particularly impactful during periods of large-scale government borrowing.\n* **TGA and RRP Interactions**:\n   * A TGA build-up often coincides with increased RRP usage, as excess liquidity flows from banks into the RRP to earn interest while being temporarily idle. This dynamic reduces the reserves available in the banking system, amplifying the liquidity drain effect.\n   * Conversely, TGA drawdowns can reduce reliance on the RRP by injecting liquidity directly into the economy, increasing reserves and the velocity of money.\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) and Money Market Dynamics\n\n# The Role of the RRP\n\n* The RRP acts as a liquidity management tool, attracting excess cash from money market participants during periods of high liquidity.\n* By setting the RRP rate, the Fed influences short-term market rates, steering liquidity toward desired levels.\n\n# Interaction with T-Bills\n\n* Money market funds (MMFs) allocate funds between the RRP and T-bills based on relative yields. When T-bill yields exceed the RRP rate, MMFs shift funds to T-bills, increasing their demand.\n* This dynamic affects liquidity distribution across financial markets, influencing short-term funding costs.\n* **Market Impact of RRP Usage**:\n   * High RRP usage reflects excess liquidity and a lack of attractive investment alternatives. It signals that market participants prefer the safety and yield of the RRP over riskier assets.\n   * Low RRP usage, or a complete depletion, suggests increased risk appetite or higher yields in alternative markets, which can signal tighter monetary conditions or shifting liquidity dynamics.\n\n# 6. Interactions with the Real Economy\n\n# Credit Creation and Multiplier Effect\n\n* Reserves provide the foundation for banks to lend. The actual expansion of credit depends on:\n   * **Borrower Demand**: Businesses and households must seek credit for productive activities.\n   * **Bank Health**: Capital adequacy and balance sheet constraints determine lending capacity.\n\n# Impact on Asset Prices\n\n* Abundant liquidity supports higher valuations for equities, real estate, and other risk assets by lowering discount rates and encouraging risk-taking.\n* Liquidity contractions can trigger market corrections, as higher rates and tighter conditions reduce investment.\n\n# Interest Rates and Borrowing Costs\n\n* The Fed’s policies shape short-term interest rates directly and influence long-term borrowing costs through market expectations, affecting consumption and investment decisions.\n\n# 7. Balancing Act: Managing Reserves, RRP, and TGA\n\nThe Fed’s challenge lies in balancing reserve levels, RRP usage, and TGA fluctuations to achieve desired monetary conditions:\n\n* **Excess Reserves**: Ensure smooth functioning of payment systems and interbank markets, preventing liquidity shortages.\n* **RRP and TGA Dynamics**: Modulate short-term liquidity without destabilizing funding markets or creating undue volatility.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Fed’s monetary mechanics operate like a finely tuned machine, with its balance sheet acting as the engine and its tools as levers. By understanding these interactions, one can appreciate how central bank policies ripple through the financial system, shaping liquidity, credit, and economic outcomes. While the mechanics are intricate, their influence is far-reaching, underscoring the pivotal role of monetary policy in modern economies.",

        "original_text": "Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it’s everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, “Only 21 million bottles will ever exist.” They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.\n\nBut here’s the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn’t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it’s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.\n\nThink about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system—one consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants—to package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin’s defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing—they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin’s code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.\n\nThis brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.\n\nStocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.\n\nFiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers—companies, governments, or individuals—to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.\n\nCryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin’s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing—no ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.\n\nBitcoin’s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, “We’re only producing 21 million bottles.” The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.\n\nThe absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.\n\nBitcoin’s price doesn’t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin’s clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin’s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren’t paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they’re paying because they believe someone else will pay more.\n\nThis speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.\n\nBitcoin isn’t digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It’s a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.\n\nWhen the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin’s price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",

        "original_text": "The markets are overreacting to the DeepSeek news. \n\nNvidia and big tech stocks losing a trillion dollars in value is not realistic. \n\nI personally am buying more NVDA stock off the dip. \n\nSo what is going on?\n\nThe reason for the drop:  Investors think DeepSeek threatens to disrupt the US big tech dominance by enabling smaller companies and cost-sensitive enterprises with an open source and low cost, high performance model. \n\nHere is why I think fears are overblown.\n\n1. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have massive war chests to outspend competitors. Nvidia alone spent nearly $9 billion on R&D in 2024 and can quickly adapt to new threats by enhancing its offerings or lowering costs if necessary.\n\n2. Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about hardware—it’s deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.\n\n3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. \n\n4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.\n\nCritiques tend to fall into two camps…\n\n1. Nvidias margins are going to be eroded \n\nTo this I think we have to acknowledge that while lower margins and demand would impact the stock both of these are speculative. \n\nIncreased efficiency typically increases demand. And Nvidias customers are pretty entrenched, it’s def not certain they will bleed customers. \n\nOn top of that Nvidia’s profitability isn’t solely tied to selling GPUs. Its software stack (e.g., CUDA), enterprise services, and licensing deals contribute significantly. These high-margin revenue streams I would guess are going to remain solid even if hardware pricing pressures increase.\n\n2. Open source has a number of relative advantages\n\nI think open source is heavily favorited by startups and indie developers (Open source is strongly favored by Reddit specifically). But the enterprise buyer doesn’t typically lean this way.\n\nOpen-source solutions require significant internal expertise for implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Large enterprises often prefer Nvidia’s support and commercial-grade stack because they get a dedicated team for ongoing updates, security patches, and scalability.",

        "original_text": "Understanding monetary liquidity is key to unpacking risk-assets. \n\nUnderstanding the mechanics of monetary systems requires unpacking the interplay between central banks, commercial banks, financial markets, and the broader economy. At its core, the Federal Reserve (Fed) operates as the cornerstone of the U.S. monetary system, managing the supply of money and credit to achieve its dual mandate: price stability and full employment. To comprehend this system, we’ll explore the Fed’s balance sheet, its tools, and how these influence the economy.\n\n# 1. The Federal Reserve Balance Sheet\n\nThe Fed’s balance sheet consists of assets and liabilities, which interact to shape liquidity and monetary conditions in the economy:\n\n# Assets\n\n1. **U.S. Treasuries**:\n   * Treasury securities (bills, notes, and bonds) are the largest asset class on the Fed’s balance sheet. They represent loans to the federal government and are considered virtually risk-free.\n   * The Fed purchases Treasuries during open market operations to inject liquidity into the financial system. These purchases lower yields, reducing borrowing costs across the economy and encouraging investment.\n   * Conversely, selling Treasuries reduces liquidity and raises yields, acting as a tightening measure.\n2. **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**:\n   * Acquired during quantitative easing (QE) programs, MBS purchases aim to stabilize the housing market by lowering mortgage rates.\n   * The Fed’s involvement in the MBS market creates demand, which supports liquidity for banks and other institutions issuing these securities.\n3. **Loans to Financial Institutions**:\n   * Includes discount window loans and emergency lending facilities. These loans provide short-term funding to banks facing liquidity crises, ensuring stability in the financial system.\n   * During financial crises, such as in 2008 or 2020, these facilities act as a critical backstop to prevent systemic collapse.\n4. **Other Assets**:\n   * This category includes foreign currency reserves, gold certificates, and various liquidity facilities established during times of stress, such as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).\n\n# Liabilities\n\n1. **Reserve Balances**:\n   * Reserves are deposits held by commercial banks at the Fed. These reserves play a central role in monetary policy as they determine the amount of liquidity in the banking system.\n   * Excess reserves, beyond what banks are required to hold, can be lent out, influencing credit creation and economic activity.\n2. **Currency in Circulation**:\n   * Physical cash held by the public and financial institutions. This is the most visible component of the money supply but represents only a fraction of total liquidity.\n3. **Treasury General Account (TGA)**:\n   * The U.S. Treasury’s account at the Fed. It acts as the government’s checking account, with inflows from tax revenues and debt issuance and outflows for spending programs.\n   * Changes in the TGA have a direct impact on reserves in the banking system, affecting liquidity.\n   * **TGA Interactions with Reserves**:\n      * When the Treasury spends (TGA drawdown), funds flow into the banking system, increasing bank reserves and liquidity. For example, payments for infrastructure projects deposit money into contractor accounts at commercial banks, raising reserve balances.\n      * Conversely, when the Treasury issues debt and deposits proceeds into the TGA (TGA build-up), reserves are drained from the banking system as banks and other institutions purchase Treasury securities, reducing liquidity. This process effectively tightens financial conditions.\n      * Large swings in the TGA balance can create volatility in reserve levels, forcing the Fed to adjust its operations to maintain stability in short-term funding markets.\n4. **Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)**:\n   * A mechanism allowing money market funds and other participants to lend cash to the Fed overnight. This temporarily reduces liquidity in the system while providing a risk-free return to lenders.\n   * **RRP Interactions with Reserves**:\n      * Funds parked in the RRP are removed from the banking system’s reserves temporarily, reducing the overall liquidity available for lending and investment. This can help the Fed manage excess reserves during periods of abundant liquidity.\n      * When funds flow out of the RRP (e.g., as MMFs chase higher yields in T-bills), reserves increase, adding liquidity back into the system. This interplay directly influences the velocity of money and the availability of credit.\n\n# 2. Key Monetary Tools and Their Mechanics\n\n# 1. Open Market Operations (OMO)\n\n* The Fed’s primary tool for managing liquidity involves buying or selling government securities in the open market.\n* **Buying Assets**: When the Fed buys Treasuries or MBS, it credits reserves to the selling bank’s account. This increases system-wide reserves and lowers interest rates by increasing the demand for these assets.\n* **Selling Assets**: When the Fed sells securities, it reduces reserves in the banking system, raising interest rates and tightening monetary conditions.\n\n# 2. Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT)\n\n* **QE**: Large-scale asset purchases by the Fed to inject liquidity into the economy. By lowering long-term interest rates, QE encourages borrowing, investment, and risk-taking.\n* **QT**: The reverse of QE, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet by allowing securities to mature or actively selling them. This drains reserves and tightens financial conditions, slowing economic activity.\n\n# 3. Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB)\n\n* The Fed pays interest on reserves held by banks. By adjusting the IORB rate, the Fed influences banks’ incentives to lend or hold reserves:\n   * **Higher IORB**: Encourages banks to hold reserves, reducing credit creation.\n   * **Lower IORB**: Promotes lending, increasing money supply and economic activity.\n\n# 4. Discount Window Lending\n\n* The Fed’s discount window provides emergency funding to banks facing short-term liquidity shortages. While rarely used under normal conditions, it’s a vital safety net during crises.\n* The availability of this facility enhances market confidence, ensuring that temporary liquidity issues don’t escalate into broader financial instability.\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)\n\n* The RRP provides a floor for short-term interest rates by offering a risk-free return for cash parked at the Fed. This tool helps the Fed maintain control over its policy rate, particularly in times of excess liquidity.\n* **Detailed RRP Mechanics**:\n   * The RRP operates by allowing money market funds, government-sponsored enterprises, and other eligible participants to invest cash with the Fed overnight. In return, participants receive a fixed interest rate.\n   * Funds placed in the RRP are effectively removed from the banking system’s reserves, reducing liquidity and high-velocity money in the economy. This dampens inflationary pressures and helps stabilize short-term interest rates.\n* **Impact of RRP Depletion**:\n   * If the RRP were emptied, participants would redirect funds into other short-term instruments like T-bills or commercial paper. This would inject liquidity back into the system, increasing bank reserves and amplifying the velocity of money.\n   * Without the RRP as a buffer, the Fed would face greater challenges in controlling short-term interest rates during periods of excess liquidity. This could lead to heightened volatility in money markets and complicate monetary policy execution.\n\n# 3. The Mechanics of Liquidity\n\n# Monetary Base vs. Money Supply\n\n* **Monetary Base (M0)**: The sum of currency in circulation and reserves held at the Fed. This forms the foundation of the money supply.\n* **Money Supply (M1, M2)**: Includes currency, demand deposits, and broader money aggregates. These reflect the multiplier effect of bank lending and public spending.\n\n# Liquidity Creation\n\n* The Fed injects reserves into the system through asset purchases or lending. Banks, in turn, use these reserves to create loans, expanding the money supply.\n* The extent of liquidity creation depends on demand for credit, regulatory constraints, and economic conditions.\n\n# Liquidity Drains\n\n* Tools like QT, RRP, and TGA operations remove liquidity by reducing reserves or diverting funds into low-velocity accounts, tightening financial conditions.\n* **Velocity of Money**:\n   * Velocity measures how quickly money circulates in the economy. High velocity indicates active economic participation and rapid money turnover, often accompanying inflationary pressures.\n   * Tools like the RRP and TGA effectively lower velocity by locking up funds in low-velocity accounts. Conversely, liquidity injections increase velocity by providing funds for spending and investment.\n\n# 4. The Treasury General Account (TGA)\n\nThe TGA functions as the government’s primary account, influencing liquidity in the financial system:\n\n* **TGA Drawdowns**: When the Treasury spends, funds flow from the TGA into the banking system. This increases bank reserves, enhancing liquidity and economic activity.\n   * For example, when the Treasury pays contractors or distributes social security benefits, the receiving entities deposit the funds in their commercial bank accounts. These deposits simultaneously increase reserve balances at the Fed.\n* **TGA Build-ups**: Conversely, when the Treasury issues debt and deposits proceeds into the TGA, reserves are drained from the banking system.\n   * The draining effect reduces the liquidity available for banks to lend and invest, tightening financial conditions. This interaction is particularly impactful during periods of large-scale government borrowing.\n* **TGA and RRP Interactions**:\n   * A TGA build-up often coincides with increased RRP usage, as excess liquidity flows from banks into the RRP to earn interest while being temporarily idle. This dynamic reduces the reserves available in the banking system, amplifying the liquidity drain effect.\n   * Conversely, TGA drawdowns can reduce reliance on the RRP by injecting liquidity directly into the economy, increasing reserves and the velocity of money.\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) and Money Market Dynamics\n\n# The Role of the RRP\n\n* The RRP acts as a liquidity management tool, attracting excess cash from money market participants during periods of high liquidity.\n* By setting the RRP rate, the Fed influences short-term market rates, steering liquidity toward desired levels.\n\n# Interaction with T-Bills\n\n* Money market funds (MMFs) allocate funds between the RRP and T-bills based on relative yields. When T-bill yields exceed the RRP rate, MMFs shift funds to T-bills, increasing their demand.\n* This dynamic affects liquidity distribution across financial markets, influencing short-term funding costs.\n* **Market Impact of RRP Usage**:\n   * High RRP usage reflects excess liquidity and a lack of attractive investment alternatives. It signals that market participants prefer the safety and yield of the RRP over riskier assets.\n   * Low RRP usage, or a complete depletion, suggests increased risk appetite or higher yields in alternative markets, which can signal tighter monetary conditions or shifting liquidity dynamics.\n\n# 6. Interactions with the Real Economy\n\n# Credit Creation and Multiplier Effect\n\n* Reserves provide the foundation for banks to lend. The actual expansion of credit depends on:\n   * **Borrower Demand**: Businesses and households must seek credit for productive activities.\n   * **Bank Health**: Capital adequacy and balance sheet constraints determine lending capacity.\n\n# Impact on Asset Prices\n\n* Abundant liquidity supports higher valuations for equities, real estate, and other risk assets by lowering discount rates and encouraging risk-taking.\n* Liquidity contractions can trigger market corrections, as higher rates and tighter conditions reduce investment.\n\n# Interest Rates and Borrowing Costs\n\n* The Fed’s policies shape short-term interest rates directly and influence long-term borrowing costs through market expectations, affecting consumption and investment decisions.\n\n# 7. Balancing Act: Managing Reserves, RRP, and TGA\n\nThe Fed’s challenge lies in balancing reserve levels, RRP usage, and TGA fluctuations to achieve desired monetary conditions:\n\n* **Excess Reserves**: Ensure smooth functioning of payment systems and interbank markets, preventing liquidity shortages.\n* **RRP and TGA Dynamics**: Modulate short-term liquidity without destabilizing funding markets or creating undue volatility.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Fed’s monetary mechanics operate like a finely tuned machine, with its balance sheet acting as the engine and its tools as levers. By understanding these interactions, one can appreciate how central bank policies ripple through the financial system, shaping liquidity, credit, and economic outcomes. While the mechanics are intricate, their influence is far-reaching, underscoring the pivotal role of monetary policy in modern economies.",

        "original_text": "Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it’s everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, “Only 21 million bottles will ever exist.” They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.\n\nBut here’s the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn’t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it’s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.\n\nThink about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system—one consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants—to package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin’s defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing—they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin’s code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.\n\nThis brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.\n\nStocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.\n\nFiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers—companies, governments, or individuals—to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.\n\nCryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin’s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing—no ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.\n\nBitcoin’s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, “We’re only producing 21 million bottles.” The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.\n\nThe absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.\n\nBitcoin’s price doesn’t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin’s clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin’s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren’t paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they’re paying because they believe someone else will pay more.\n\nThis speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.\n\nBitcoin isn’t digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It’s a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.\n\nWhen the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin’s price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",

After a few months, I decided to focus more on a specific selection and stopped adding to some of the earlier purchases.\n\nCurrently, my portfolio is mainly concentrated in four stock ETFs and one bond ETF, but after a year, I’ve noticed that my allocation might not be as balanced as I initially thought. There’s some overlap in exposure across multiple ETFs, and I’m considering how to adjust for better diversification, especially in case of market downturns.\n\nAs of this month, my salary has increased, and I’m now working remotely, which should allow me to save more.

The market outperforms gold in terms of generating a profit, beating inflation, beating the risk-free rate, and controlling downside deviation.

        "original_text": "Understanding monetary liquidity is key to unpacking risk-assets. \n\nUnderstanding the mechanics of monetary systems requires unpacking the interplay between central banks, commercial banks, financial markets, and the broader economy. At its core, the Federal Reserve (Fed) operates as the cornerstone of the U.S. monetary system, managing the supply of money and credit to achieve its dual mandate: price stability and full employment. To comprehend this system, we’ll explore the Fed’s balance sheet, its tools, and how these influence the economy.\n\n# 1. The Federal Reserve Balance Sheet\n\nThe Fed’s balance sheet consists of assets and liabilities, which interact to shape liquidity and monetary conditions in the economy:\n\n# Assets\n\n1. **U.S. Treasuries**:\n   * Treasury securities (bills, notes, and bonds) are the largest asset class on the Fed’s balance sheet. They represent loans to the federal government and are considered virtually risk-free.\n   * The Fed purchases Treasuries during open market operations to inject liquidity into the financial system. These purchases lower yields, reducing borrowing costs across the economy and encouraging investment.\n   * Conversely, selling Treasuries reduces liquidity and raises yields, acting as a tightening measure.\n2. **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**:\n   * Acquired during quantitative easing (QE) programs, MBS purchases aim to stabilize the housing market by lowering mortgage rates.\n   * The Fed’s involvement in the MBS market creates demand, which supports liquidity for banks and other institutions issuing these securities.\n3. **Loans to Financial Institutions**:\n   * Includes discount window loans and emergency lending facilities. These loans provide short-term funding to banks facing liquidity crises, ensuring stability in the financial system.\n   * During financial crises, such as in 2008 or 2020, these facilities act as a critical backstop to prevent systemic collapse.\n4. **Other Assets**:\n   * This category includes foreign currency reserves, gold certificates, and various liquidity facilities established during times of stress, such as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).\n\n# Liabilities\n\n1. **Reserve Balances**:\n   * Reserves are deposits held by commercial banks at the Fed. These reserves play a central role in monetary policy as they determine the amount of liquidity in the banking system.\n   * Excess reserves, beyond what banks are required to hold, can be lent out, influencing credit creation and economic activity.\n2. **Currency in Circulation**:\n   * Physical cash held by the public and financial institutions. This is the most visible component of the money supply but represents only a fraction of total liquidity.\n3. **Treasury General Account (TGA)**:\n   * The U.S. Treasury’s account at the Fed. It acts as the government’s checking account, with inflows from tax revenues and debt issuance and outflows for spending programs.\n   * Changes in the TGA have a direct impact on reserves in the banking system, affecting liquidity.\n   * **TGA Interactions with Reserves**:\n      * When the Treasury spends (TGA drawdown), funds flow into the banking system, increasing bank reserves and liquidity. For example, payments for infrastructure projects deposit money into contractor accounts at commercial banks, raising reserve balances.\n      * Conversely, when the Treasury issues debt and deposits proceeds into the TGA (TGA build-up), reserves are drained from the banking system as banks and other institutions purchase Treasury securities, reducing liquidity. This process effectively tightens financial conditions.\n      * Large swings in the TGA balance can create volatility in reserve levels, forcing the Fed to adjust its operations to maintain stability in short-term funding markets.\n4. **Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)**:\n   * A mechanism allowing money market funds and other participants to lend cash to the Fed overnight. This temporarily reduces liquidity in the system while providing a risk-free return to lenders.\n   * **RRP Interactions with Reserves**:\n      * Funds parked in the RRP are removed from the banking system’s reserves temporarily, reducing the overall liquidity available for lending and investment. This can help the Fed manage excess reserves during periods of abundant liquidity.\n      * When funds flow out of the RRP (e.g., as MMFs chase higher yields in T-bills), reserves increase, adding liquidity back into the system. This interplay directly influences the velocity of money and the availability of credit.\n\n# 2. Key Monetary Tools and Their Mechanics\n\n# 1. Open Market Operations (OMO)\n\n* The Fed’s primary tool for managing liquidity involves buying or selling government securities in the open market.\n* **Buying Assets**: When the Fed buys Treasuries or MBS, it credits reserves to the selling bank’s account. This increases system-wide reserves and lowers interest rates by increasing the demand for these assets.\n* **Selling Assets**: When the Fed sells securities, it reduces reserves in the banking system, raising interest rates and tightening monetary conditions.\n\n# 2. Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT)\n\n* **QE**: Large-scale asset purchases by the Fed to inject liquidity into the economy. By lowering long-term interest rates, QE encourages borrowing, investment, and risk-taking.\n* **QT**: The reverse of QE, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet by allowing securities to mature or actively selling them. This drains reserves and tightens financial conditions, slowing economic activity.\n\n# 3. Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB)\n\n* The Fed pays interest on reserves held by banks. By adjusting the IORB rate, the Fed influences banks’ incentives to lend or hold reserves:\n   * **Higher IORB**: Encourages banks to hold reserves, reducing credit creation.\n   * **Lower IORB**: Promotes lending, increasing money supply and economic activity.\n\n# 4. Discount Window Lending\n\n* The Fed’s discount window provides emergency funding to banks facing short-term liquidity shortages. While rarely used under normal conditions, it’s a vital safety net during crises.\n* The availability of this facility enhances market confidence, ensuring that temporary liquidity issues don’t escalate into broader financial instability.\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)\n\n* The RRP provides a floor for short-term interest rates by offering a risk-free return for cash parked at the Fed. This tool helps the Fed maintain control over its policy rate, particularly in times of excess liquidity.\n* **Detailed RRP Mechanics**:\n   * The RRP operates by allowing money market funds, government-sponsored enterprises, and other eligible participants to invest cash with the Fed overnight. In return, participants receive a fixed interest rate.\n   * Funds placed in the RRP are effectively removed from the banking system’s reserves, reducing liquidity and high-velocity money in the economy. This dampens inflationary pressures and helps stabilize short-term interest rates.\n* **Impact of RRP Depletion**:\n   * If the RRP were emptied, participants would redirect funds into other short-term instruments like T-bills or commercial paper. This would inject liquidity back into the system, increasing bank reserves and amplifying the velocity of money.\n   * Without the RRP as a buffer, the Fed would face greater challenges in controlling short-term interest rates during periods of excess liquidity. This could lead to heightened volatility in money markets and complicate monetary policy execution.\n\n# 3. The Mechanics of Liquidity\n\n# Monetary Base vs. Money Supply\n\n* **Monetary Base (M0)**: The sum of currency in circulation and reserves held at the Fed. This forms the foundation of the money supply.\n* **Money Supply (M1, M2)**: Includes currency, demand deposits, and broader money aggregates. These reflect the multiplier effect of bank lending and public spending.\n\n# Liquidity Creation\n\n* The Fed injects reserves into the system through asset purchases or lending. Banks, in turn, use these reserves to create loans, expanding the money supply.\n* The extent of liquidity creation depends on demand for credit, regulatory constraints, and economic conditions.\n\n# Liquidity Drains\n\n* Tools like QT, RRP, and TGA operations remove liquidity by reducing reserves or diverting funds into low-velocity accounts, tightening financial conditions.\n* **Velocity of Money**:\n   * Velocity measures how quickly money circulates in the economy. High velocity indicates active economic participation and rapid money turnover, often accompanying inflationary pressures.\n   * Tools like the RRP and TGA effectively lower velocity by locking up funds in low-velocity accounts. Conversely, liquidity injections increase velocity by providing funds for spending and investment.\n\n# 4. The Treasury General Account (TGA)\n\nThe TGA functions as the government’s primary account, influencing liquidity in the financial system:\n\n* **TGA Drawdowns**: When the Treasury spends, funds flow from the TGA into the banking system. This increases bank reserves, enhancing liquidity and economic activity.\n   * For example, when the Treasury pays contractors or distributes social security benefits, the receiving entities deposit the funds in their commercial bank accounts. These deposits simultaneously increase reserve balances at the Fed.\n* **TGA Build-ups**: Conversely, when the Treasury issues debt and deposits proceeds into the TGA, reserves are drained from the banking system.\n   * The draining effect reduces the liquidity available for banks to lend and invest, tightening financial conditions. This interaction is particularly impactful during periods of large-scale government borrowing.\n* **TGA and RRP Interactions**:\n   * A TGA build-up often coincides with increased RRP usage, as excess liquidity flows from banks into the RRP to earn interest while being temporarily idle. This dynamic reduces the reserves available in the banking system, amplifying the liquidity drain effect.\n   * Conversely, TGA drawdowns can reduce reliance on the RRP by injecting liquidity directly into the economy, increasing reserves and the velocity of money.\n\n# 5. Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) and Money Market Dynamics\n\n# The Role of the RRP\n\n* The RRP acts as a liquidity management tool, attracting excess cash from money market participants during periods of high liquidity.\n* By setting the RRP rate, the Fed influences short-term market rates, steering liquidity toward desired levels.\n\n# Interaction with T-Bills\n\n* Money market funds (MMFs) allocate funds between the RRP and T-bills based on relative yields. When T-bill yields exceed the RRP rate, MMFs shift funds to T-bills, increasing their demand.\n* This dynamic affects liquidity distribution across financial markets, influencing short-term funding costs.\n* **Market Impact of RRP Usage**:\n   * High RRP usage reflects excess liquidity and a lack of attractive investment alternatives. It signals that market participants prefer the safety and yield of the RRP over riskier assets.\n   * Low RRP usage, or a complete depletion, suggests increased risk appetite or higher yields in alternative markets, which can signal tighter monetary conditions or shifting liquidity dynamics.\n\n# 6. Interactions with the Real Economy\n\n# Credit Creation and Multiplier Effect\n\n* Reserves provide the foundation for banks to lend. The actual expansion of credit depends on:\n   * **Borrower Demand**: Businesses and households must seek credit for productive activities.\n   * **Bank Health**: Capital adequacy and balance sheet constraints determine lending capacity.\n\n# Impact on Asset Prices\n\n* Abundant liquidity supports higher valuations for equities, real estate, and other risk assets by lowering discount rates and encouraging risk-taking.\n* Liquidity contractions can trigger market corrections, as higher rates and tighter conditions reduce investment.\n\n# Interest Rates and Borrowing Costs\n\n* The Fed’s policies shape short-term interest rates directly and influence long-term borrowing costs through market expectations, affecting consumption and investment decisions.\n\n# 7. Balancing Act: Managing Reserves, RRP, and TGA\n\nThe Fed’s challenge lies in balancing reserve levels, RRP usage, and TGA fluctuations to achieve desired monetary conditions:\n\n* **Excess Reserves**: Ensure smooth functioning of payment systems and interbank markets, preventing liquidity shortages.\n* **RRP and TGA Dynamics**: Modulate short-term liquidity without destabilizing funding markets or creating undue volatility.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Fed’s monetary mechanics operate like a finely tuned machine, with its balance sheet acting as the engine and its tools as levers. By understanding these interactions, one can appreciate how central bank policies ripple through the financial system, shaping liquidity, credit, and economic outcomes. While the mechanics are intricate, their influence is far-reaching, underscoring the pivotal role of monetary policy in modern economies.",

Each month, I manage to save a few hundred euros, and I’m considering whether it makes sense to move away from traditional bank accounts and try investing in low-risk options instead. I’m curious about whether achieving a 10-20% annual return is realistic for someone just starting out.\n\nFor example, I’ve heard that the S&P 500 index is a solid choice, but there are several variations of it on the Revolut app, and I’m not entirely sure how to decide which one might be the right fit. Has anyone here tried investing through Revolut in Europe? I’m also interested in gold stocks, as they’re often considered a safe bet, but I wonder if that holds true for someone with limited experience.\n\nI’d love to hear what others think about starting with low-risk investments like these and whether there are other strategies or stocks you’ve found useful for beginners. What’s your take?\n\nLooking forward to discussing!\n ",

And I know, the price at close today was higher.\n\n# Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE: KODK) – Equity Research Report\n\n# Rating: Overweight | Target Price: $18.50 | Current Price: $6.79\n\n# Sector: Specialty Chemicals & Industrial Manufacturing\n\n# Investment Summary\n\nWe initiate coverage on Eastman Kodak (NYSE: KODK) with an **Overweight** rating and a **target price of $18.50**, representing a **172% upside**. Kodak is undergoing a **structural transformation**, pivoting from a declining legacy print business into higher-margin verticals such as **pharmaceutical manufacturing and advanced materials**. Despite strong **underlying asset value**, significant **hidden real estate assets**, and a **near-term deleveraging catalyst**, the stock trades at **only 0.4x book value**, well below its intrinsic worth.\n\nWe believe **Wall Street misprices Kodak** by failing to incorporate:  \n✅ The **imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025**, with attractive margin dynamics.  \n✅ **Debt reduction from pension surplus**, improving FCF and balance sheet health.  \n✅ **Strong tariff tailwinds under the Trump administration**, positioning Kodak as a beneficiary of U.S. domestic manufacturing policies.  \n✅ **Underappreciated real estate assets (Eastman Business Park)**, with a potential fair value of **$175M-$200M**.\n\n# Valuation Snapshot\n\n|**Metric**|**Base Case ($/Share)**|**Bear Case ($/Share)**|**Bull Case ($/Share)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**DCF Valuation**|**$18.42**|**$11.63**|**$24.00**|\n|**Liquidation Value**|**$17.78**|**$12.50**|**$22.50**|\n|**EV/EBITDA Valuation**|**$12.30**|**$9.75**|**$15.00**|\n|**P/E Valuation (12x Earnings)**|**$11.35**|**$8.50**|**$13.50**|\n|**Current Market Price**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|\n\n📌 **Our target price of $18.50 is based on a blended DCF and sum-of-the-parts valuation.**\n\n# 1. Company Overview & Strategic Pivot\n\nKodak operates across **four primary segments**:\n\n1. **Print & Imaging (55% of 2024 revenue)**\n   * Declining legacy business, but Kodak is stabilizing margins at **20% gross margin**.\n2. **Advanced Materials & Chemicals (22%)**\n   * High-margin segment (**27% EBITDA margin**) that supplies key specialty chemicals.\n3. **Brand Licensing & Real Estate (10%)**\n   * Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP), a 1,200-acre industrial park** undervalued on the balance sheet.\n4. **Pharmaceuticals (13% by 2025)**\n   * New revenue driver, projected to **generate $149M in 2025 with 35% margins**.\n\nKodak’s **pharmaceutical expansion** is the primary catalyst for **margin improvement and revenue diversification**. With **government incentives supporting domestic drug manufacturing**, Kodak is well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\n# 2. Financial Model & Valuation\n\n# 2.1 Revenue Breakdown & Forecast (2025-2029)\n\n|**Division**|**2024 Revenue ($M)**|**2025 Revenue ($M)**|**2029 Revenue ($M) (Bull Case)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Print & Imaging**|**$570M**|**$550M** (Decline)|**$510M**|\n|**Advanced Materials & Chemicals**|**$228M**|**$239M** (Growth)|**$290M**|\n|**Brand Licensing & Real Estate**|**$104M**|**$108M**|**$120M**|\n|**Pharma Division (New)**|**$135M**|**$149M** (Growth)|**$250M**|\n|**Total Revenue**|**$1,037M**|**$1,141M**|**$1,170M**|\n\n# 2.2 EBITDA & Free Cash Flow (FCF) Model\n\n|**Metric**|**2024 (Estimate)**|**2025 (Projected)**|**2026-2029 (Avg.)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**EBITDA ($M)**|**$180M**|**$210M**|**$225M**|\n|**FCF ($M)**|**$80M**|**$120M**|**$150M**|\n|**Net Debt ($M)**|**$460M**|**$145M**|**$50M**|\n|**Net Debt / EBITDA**|**2.6x**|**0.7x**|**0.2x**|\n\n📌 **Kodak is set to generate $120M in FCF in 2025**, a **50% improvement from 2024** due to lower CAPEX and debt reduction.\n\n# 3. Key Catalysts & Upside Drivers\n\n# 3.1 Pension Surplus & Debt Reduction\n\n* Kodak **will use $315M in pension assets to reduce debt**, lowering interest costs by **$25M annually**.\n* **Net debt will decline to $145M, reducing leverage to 0.7x EBITDA.**\n* This **significantly increases Free Cash Flow (FCF) starting in 2025**.\n\n# 3.2 Pharma Division Launch in 2025\n\n* Kodak’s **API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) manufacturing facility** is near completion.\n* The pharma sector offers **30%-40% gross margins**, significantly higher than print.\n* **Government incentives for domestic API production could drive contract wins.**\n* **Projected revenue: $149M in 2025 → $250M by 2029.**\n\n# 3.3 Trade Tariff Tailwinds\n\n* **Trump’s trade policies favor U.S. manufacturers** in specialty chemicals and pharma.\n* Tariffs on **Chinese imports** could make Kodak’s products **more competitive**.\n* **Kodak is well-positioned as a U.S.-based supplier**.\n\n# 3.4 Real Estate Monetization - Hidden Value in EBP\n\n* **Eastman Business Park (EBP)** is worth **$175M-$200M**, but it’s booked at **$60M**.\n* Leasing out or **selling portions of EBP could unlock value**.\n\n# 4. Investment Risks & Mitigation\n\n|**Risk Factor**|**Impact**|**Mitigation Strategy**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Declining Print Business**|Print revenue declining 5% YoY.|**high-margin Pharma & Chemicals**Focus on  .|\n|**Execution Risk in Pharma**|Regulatory or contract issues.|**Target pre-signed API supply contracts**.|\n|**Supply Chain & Tariff Risks**|Cost increases from import tariffs.|**Domestic manufacturing advantage** offsets risk.|\n\n# 5. Conclusion: A Deep Value Play\n\nKodak presents a **compelling risk-reward opportunity** driven by:\n\n1. **Pharma division launch in 2025** (high-margin growth engine).\n2. **Debt reduction through pension surplus**, boosting FCF.\n3. **Hidden real estate value in Eastman Business Park**.\n4. **Trade tailwinds under Trump favoring domestic manufacturing**.\n\n📌 **Rating: Overweight**  \n📌 **Target Price: $18.50** (172% upside)\n\nKodak is a **highly asymmetric deep-value opportunity** with significant potential for re-rating in 2025. 🚀\n\n\n\n# ELI5: Why Kodak is a Good Investment Right Now 📈\n\nImagine you have **an old company like Kodak**, which used to make cameras and films. People think it’s outdated, but here’s the **secret**—Kodak is quietly transforming into something much bigger. And **Wall Street isn’t paying attention yet**.\n\nHere’s why **smart investors** might want to take a closer look at Kodak:\n\n# 1️⃣ Kodak Is Getting Into Pharmaceuticals (Drugs 💊)\n\n* Kodak is **building a factory** to make ingredients for medicines.\n* This **new business starts in 2025** and will make **a lot more money per dollar spent** than selling old-school film and prints.\n* Think of it like Kodak **switching from selling DVDs to streaming movies—it’s the future!**\n* **This new drug business could bring in over $250M a year** in just a few years.\n\n# 2️⃣ Kodak Is Paying Off a TON of Debt 💰\n\n* Kodak had **a special pension fund with $1.08 BILLION** saved up.\n* They will use **$315M to pay down debt**, meaning they **don’t have to pay as much interest anymore**.\n* **This frees up an extra $25M per year!**\n* Less debt = **stronger company + more money to grow the business**.\n\n# 3️⃣ Hidden Gold Mine: Kodak Owns a HUGE Industrial Park 🏭\n\n* Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP)**, a **1,200-acre** industrial site.\n* Right now, it’s on the books for **only $60M**, but it’s actually worth **$175M+**.\n* If they **sell or rent out more space**, Kodak could **make a lot of extra money**.\n\n# 4️⃣ The Government Might Help Kodak (Trump's Trade Policies 🇺🇸)\n\n* The U.S. **wants to make more stuff at home** (like medicine and tech parts).\n* Kodak **makes things in America**, which means **they could get government support** and win new contracts.\n* If new tariffs (taxes on foreign goods) happen, Kodak’s **U.S.-made products become more valuable**.\n\n# 5️⃣ Kodak’s Stock Is TOO CHEAP 📉\n\n📌 **Right now, Kodak is trading at $6.79 per share.**  \n📌 **Experts say it should be worth between $11.50 - $24.00 per share!**  \n📌 That means the stock **could DOUBLE or even TRIPLE** in price.\n\n# 💡 What’s Next?\n\nKodak is **no longer just an “old camera company.”** With **pharma, real estate, and smart debt moves**, it **could become a big winner** in the next couple of years.\n\n✅ **New drug business = more profits**  \n✅ **Less debt = more cash to grow**  \n✅ **Hidden assets = even more value**  \n✅ **Government policies = possible tailwinds**\n\n**Right now, Wall Street isn’t paying attention… but soon, they might.** 🚀 \n\n\n\nSources:  \n[https://investor.kodak.com/financial-information/sec-filings](https://investor.kodak.com/financial-information/sec-filings)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-pharmaceutical-ingredient-factory-nearing-completion/amp/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-pharmaceutical-ingredient-factory-nearing-completion/amp/)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-prepares-to-terminate-u-s-pension-book-gain-of-more-than-500-million-d0cfb621](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-prepares-to-terminate-u-s-pension-book-gain-of-more-than-500-million-d0cfb621)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-looks-to-terminate-us-pensions-will-gain-over-500-million-in-finances/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-looks-to-terminate-us-pensions-will-gain-over-500-million-in-finances/)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-increases-film-production-capacity-to-meet-commercial-consumer-demand/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-increases-film-production-capacity-to-meet-commercial-consumer-demand/)  \n  \n[https://www.alcircle.com/news/kodak-s-call-for-tariffs-answered-us-to-impose-hefty-duties-on-imported-aluminium-printing-plates-112353?srsltid=AfmBOoqcAD-pC6yafn8auf4oN60aQaPUrgDLx2vh3zrUHHJyXT-TQNqx](https://www.alcircle.com/news/kodak-s-call-for-tariffs-answered-us-to-impose-hefty-duties-on-imported-aluminium-printing-plates-112353?srsltid=AfmBOoqcAD-pC6yafn8auf4oN60aQaPUrgDLx2vh3zrUHHJyXT-TQNqx)  \n\n\nBonus, real life DD:  \n  \nI did not know, but check how active are the Kodak clients/fans on other subredits there are literally dozens of posts each day including the word \"Kodak\".   \nAlso, the 90s are trendy these days, it is not unusual to see Gen Z youngsters with analogic cameras.",

So it is not intended as financial advice of any kind.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fn7o03doztfe1.png?width=270&format=png&auto=webp&s=939da4c7213e1a30ff5e790cd2c52bdead1648ec\n\nSince english is not my first language, I used some AI magic to wrap up all my DD in two different formats (equity research and ELI5). And I know, the price at close today was higher.\n\n# Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE: KODK) – Equity Research Report\n\n# Rating: Overweight | Target Price: $18.50 | Current Price: $6.79\n\n# Sector: Specialty Chemicals & Industrial Manufacturing\n\n# Investment Summary\n\nWe initiate coverage on Eastman Kodak (NYSE: KODK) with an **Overweight** rating and a **target price of $18.50**, representing a **172% upside**. Kodak is undergoing a **structural transformation**, pivoting from a declining legacy print business into higher-margin verticals such as **pharmaceutical manufacturing and advanced materials**. Despite strong **underlying asset value**, significant **hidden real estate assets**, and a **near-term deleveraging catalyst**, the stock trades at **only 0.4x book value**, well below its intrinsic worth.\n\nWe believe **Wall Street misprices Kodak** by failing to incorporate:  \n✅ The **imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025**, with attractive margin dynamics.  \n✅ **Debt reduction from pension surplus**, improving FCF and balance sheet health.  \n✅ **Strong tariff tailwinds under the Trump administration**, positioning Kodak as a beneficiary of U.S. domestic manufacturing policies.  \n✅ **Underappreciated real estate assets (Eastman Business Park)**, with a potential fair value of **$175M-$200M**.\n\n# Valuation Snapshot\n\n|**Metric**|**Base Case ($/Share)**|**Bear Case ($/Share)**|**Bull Case ($/Share)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**DCF Valuation**|**$18.42**|**$11.63**|**$24.00**|\n|**Liquidation Value**|**$17.78**|**$12.50**|**$22.50**|\n|**EV/EBITDA Valuation**|**$12.30**|**$9.75**|**$15.00**|\n|**P/E Valuation (12x Earnings)**|**$11.35**|**$8.50**|**$13.50**|\n|**Current Market Price**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|\n\n📌 **Our target price of $18.50 is based on a blended DCF and sum-of-the-parts valuation.**\n\n# 1. Company Overview & Strategic Pivot\n\nKodak operates across **four primary segments**:\n\n1. **Print & Imaging (55% of 2024 revenue)**\n   * Declining legacy business, but Kodak is stabilizing margins at **20% gross margin**.\n2. **Advanced Materials & Chemicals (22%)**\n   * High-margin segment (**27% EBITDA margin**) that supplies key specialty chemicals.\n3. **Brand Licensing & Real Estate (10%)**\n   * Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP), a 1,200-acre industrial park** undervalued on the balance sheet.\n4. **Pharmaceuticals (13% by 2025)**\n   * New revenue driver, projected to **generate $149M in 2025 with 35% margins**.\n\nKodak’s **pharmaceutical expansion** is the primary catalyst for **margin improvement and revenue diversification**. With **government incentives supporting domestic drug manufacturing**, Kodak is well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\n# 2. Financial Model & Valuation\n\n# 2.1 Revenue Breakdown & Forecast (2025-2029)\n\n|**Division**|**2024 Revenue ($M)**|**2025 Revenue ($M)**|**2029 Revenue ($M) (Bull Case)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Print & Imaging**|**$570M**|**$550M** (Decline)|**$510M**|\n|**Advanced Materials & Chemicals**|**$228M**|**$239M** (Growth)|**$290M**|\n|**Brand Licensing & Real Estate**|**$104M**|**$108M**|**$120M**|\n|**Pharma Division (New)**|**$135M**|**$149M** (Growth)|**$250M**|\n|**Total Revenue**|**$1,037M**|**$1,141M**|**$1,170M**|\n\n# 2.2 EBITDA & Free Cash Flow (FCF) Model\n\n|**Metric**|**2024 (Estimate)**|**2025 (Projected)**|**2026-2029 (Avg.)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**EBITDA ($M)**|**$180M**|**$210M**|**$225M**|\n|**FCF ($M)**|**$80M**|**$120M**|**$150M**|\n|**Net Debt ($M)**|**$460M**|**$145M**|**$50M**|\n|**Net Debt / EBITDA**|**2.6x**|**0.7x**|**0.2x**|\n\n📌 **Kodak is set to generate $120M in FCF in 2025**, a **50% improvement from 2024** due to lower CAPEX and debt reduction.\n\n# 3. Key Catalysts & Upside Drivers\n\n# 3.1 Pension Surplus & Debt Reduction\n\n* Kodak **will use $315M in pension assets to reduce debt**, lowering interest costs by **$25M annually**.\n* **Net debt will decline to $145M, reducing leverage to 0.7x EBITDA.**\n* This **significantly increases Free Cash Flow (FCF) starting in 2025**.\n\n# 3.2 Pharma Division Launch in 2025\n\n* Kodak’s **API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) manufacturing facility** is near completion.\n* The pharma sector offers **30%-40% gross margins**, significantly higher than print.\n* **Government incentives for domestic API production could drive contract wins.**\n* **Projected revenue: $149M in 2025 → $250M by 2029.**\n\n# 3.3 Trade Tariff Tailwinds\n\n* **Trump’s trade policies favor U.S. manufacturers** in specialty chemicals and pharma.\n* Tariffs on **Chinese imports** could make Kodak’s products **more competitive**.\n* **Kodak is well-positioned as a U.S.-based supplier**.\n\n# 3.4 Real Estate Monetization - Hidden Value in EBP\n\n* **Eastman Business Park (EBP)** is worth **$175M-$200M**, but it’s booked at **$60M**.\n* Leasing out or **selling portions of EBP could unlock value**.\n\n# 4. Investment Risks & Mitigation\n\n|**Risk Factor**|**Impact**|**Mitigation Strategy**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Declining Print Business**|Print revenue declining 5% YoY.|**high-margin Pharma & Chemicals**Focus on  .|\n|**Execution Risk in Pharma**|Regulatory or contract issues.|**Target pre-signed API supply contracts**.|\n|**Supply Chain & Tariff Risks**|Cost increases from import tariffs.|**Domestic manufacturing advantage** offsets risk.|\n\n# 5. Conclusion: A Deep Value Play\n\nKodak presents a **compelling risk-reward opportunity** driven by:\n\n1. **Pharma division launch in 2025** (high-margin growth engine).\n2. **Debt reduction through pension surplus**, boosting FCF.\n3. **Hidden real estate value in Eastman Business Park**.\n4. **Trade tailwinds under Trump favoring domestic manufacturing**.\n\n📌 **Rating: Overweight**  \n📌 **Target Price: $18.50** (172% upside)\n\nKodak is a **highly asymmetric deep-value opportunity** with significant potential for re-rating in 2025. 🚀\n\n\n\n# ELI5: Why Kodak is a Good Investment Right Now 📈\n\nImagine you have **an old company like Kodak**, which used to make cameras and films. People think it’s outdated, but here’s the **secret**—Kodak is quietly transforming into something much bigger. And **Wall Street isn’t paying attention yet**.\n\nHere’s why **smart investors** might want to take a closer look at Kodak:\n\n# 1️⃣ Kodak Is Getting Into Pharmaceuticals (Drugs 💊)\n\n* Kodak is **building a factory** to make ingredients for medicines.\n* This **new business starts in 2025** and will make **a lot more money per dollar spent** than selling old-school film and prints.\n* Think of it like Kodak **switching from selling DVDs to streaming movies—it’s the future!**\n* **This new drug business could bring in over $250M a year** in just a few years.\n\n# 2️⃣ Kodak Is Paying Off a TON of Debt 💰\n\n* Kodak had **a special pension fund with $1.08 BILLION** saved up.\n* They will use **$315M to pay down debt**, meaning they **don’t have to pay as much interest anymore**.\n* **This frees up an extra $25M per year!**\n* Less debt = **stronger company + more money to grow the business**.\n\n# 3️⃣ Hidden Gold Mine: Kodak Owns a HUGE Industrial Park 🏭\n\n* Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP)**, a **1,200-acre** industrial site.\n* Right now, it’s on the books for **only $60M**, but it’s actually worth **$175M+**.\n* If they **sell or rent out more space**, Kodak could **make a lot of extra money**.\n\n# 4️⃣ The Government Might Help Kodak (Trump's Trade Policies 🇺🇸)\n\n* The U.S. **wants to make more stuff at home** (like medicine and tech parts).\n* Kodak **makes things in America**, which means **they could get government support** and win new contracts.\n* If new tariffs (taxes on foreign goods) happen, Kodak’s **U.S.-made products become more valuable**.\n\n# 5️⃣ Kodak’s Stock Is TOO CHEAP 📉\n\n📌 **Right now, Kodak is trading at $6.79 per share.**  \n📌 **Experts say it should be worth between $11.50 - $24.00 per share!**  \n📌 That means the stock **could DOUBLE or even TRIPLE** in price.\n\n# 💡 What’s Next?\n\nKodak is **no longer just an “old camera company.”** With **pharma, real estate, and smart debt moves**, it **could become a big winner** in the next couple of years.\n\n✅ **New drug business = more profits**  \n✅ **Less debt = more cash to grow**  \n✅ **Hidden assets = even more value**  \n✅ **Government policies = possible tailwinds**\n\n**Right now, Wall Street isn’t paying attention… but soon, they might.** 🚀 \n\n\n\nSources:  \n[https://investor.kodak.com/financial-information/sec-filings](https://investor.kodak.com/financial-information/sec-filings)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-pharmaceutical-ingredient-factory-nearing-completion/amp/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-pharmaceutical-ingredient-factory-nearing-completion/amp/)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-prepares-to-terminate-u-s-pension-book-gain-of-more-than-500-million-d0cfb621](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-prepares-to-terminate-u-s-pension-book-gain-of-more-than-500-million-d0cfb621)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-looks-to-terminate-us-pensions-will-gain-over-500-million-in-finances/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-looks-to-terminate-us-pensions-will-gain-over-500-million-in-finances/)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-increases-film-production-capacity-to-meet-commercial-consumer-demand/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-increases-film-production-capacity-to-meet-commercial-consumer-demand/)  \n  \n[https://www.alcircle.com/news/kodak-s-call-for-tariffs-answered-us-to-impose-hefty-duties-on-imported-aluminium-printing-plates-112353?srsltid=AfmBOoqcAD-pC6yafn8auf4oN60aQaPUrgDLx2vh3zrUHHJyXT-TQNqx](https://www.alcircle.com/news/kodak-s-call-for-tariffs-answered-us-to-impose-hefty-duties-on-imported-aluminium-printing-plates-112353?srsltid=AfmBOoqcAD-pC6yafn8auf4oN60aQaPUrgDLx2vh3zrUHHJyXT-TQNqx)  \n\n\nBonus, real life DD:  \n  \nI did not know, but check how active are the Kodak clients/fans on other subredits there are literally dozens of posts each day including the word \"Kodak\".   \nAlso, the 90s are trendy these days, it is not unusual to see Gen Z youngsters with analogic cameras.",

        "original_text": "We are now approaching the point where a new commitment may no longer be possible. As a result of the recession and the ensuing financial crisis, the Fed will no longer be able to target inflation and will be forced to lower interest rates and start buying assets from the market. More precisely, the Fed could continue to target inflation, but only at the cost of a collapse of the banking system and a massive decline in the real economy.\n\nAlthough, as we can see, the state apparatus is clearly against it and continues to keep the economy afloat at the expense of a budget deficit of 7-8% of GDP. And it is unclear what can or should change in their approach. They created the inflationary wave and are still supporting it. Moreover, they will be the first to rush to the rescue of all the drowning, handing out money left and right. Yes, maybe not right away, after all, the fallen assets will be picked up, but they will do it anyway.\n\nMoreover, the whole world will ask them to lower the interest rate and save the banks and other actors, because at that point it will be even worse for them. Only the consequence of such a bailout will be a further increase in inflation at a low rate.\n\nIn general, the next commitment (first - the gold peg completed in 1971, second - real negative interest rates since 2009, third - 2% inflation) will finally be broken (not counting the already completed period of high inflation in 2021-2022) and, of course, it will have consequences for the reserve status of the dollar, in addition to those mentioned above.",

        "original_text": "Hi regards. Since markets are closed today and we're all bored as fuck, I'm gonna drop some insight on all y'all that want to gamble away your mortgages and college tuitions.\n\nWe've seen a few trends over the last few months where some previously-beat-up tickers went from trash to gold. I'm gonna call this trend \"shit we thought we'd have in the future because we watched a lot of sci-fi movies\". 2024 was the year of AI, then it was the space stocks (RKLB, LUNR, etc). Then it was the flying car stocks (ARCH, JOBY, etc). Then we all saw the quantum stock bubble (though any regard with a CS degree could have told you the same thing that Jensen did). So, what sci-fi future shit is left to invest in? Robots, obviously!\n\nExcept, robots, like space rockets, are real. And they're already in market and getting better rapidly. 2025 is the year when they'll really start to go mainstream, largely because software is the biggest limiting factor to how good robots are today. With recent advancements in AI, robots are going to start getting \\*A LOT\\* better.\n\nFurther supporting my bullish thesis is NVIDIA's recent release of their Cosmos Wold Foundation Model  (https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-cosmos-world-foundation-model-platform-to-accelerate-physical-ai-development). Why is this a big deal? because, this will really lower the cost of entry for the robot manufacturers as they won't have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to train a vision model by themselves. Now they can just equip their bots with some commodity sensors & cameras and build out the hardware bot for their use case.\n\nPositions:\n\nDue to market-cap requirements here, the only one I can mention is SERV - holding 2000 shares and 20 LEAP contracts for May.\n\nI have a bag of bunch of other tickers in the space that have a 250-500M valuation.",

Kodak is undergoing a **structural transformation**, pivoting from a declining legacy print business into higher-margin verticals such as **pharmaceutical manufacturing and advanced materials**. Despite strong **underlying asset value**, significant **hidden real estate assets**, and a **near-term deleveraging catalyst**, the stock trades at **only 0.4x book value**, well below its intrinsic worth.\n\nWe believe **Wall Street misprices Kodak** by failing to incorporate:  \n✅ The **imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025**, with attractive margin dynamics.  \n✅ **Debt reduction from pension surplus**, improving FCF and balance sheet health.  \n✅ **Strong tariff tailwinds under the Trump administration**, positioning Kodak as a beneficiary of U.S. domestic manufacturing policies.  \n✅ **Underappreciated real estate assets (Eastman Business Park)**, with a potential fair value of **$175M-$200M**.\n\n# Valuation Snapshot\n\n|**Metric**|**Base Case ($/Share)**|**Bear Case ($/Share)**|**Bull Case ($/Share)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**DCF Valuation**|**$18.42**|**$11.63**|**$24.00**|\n|**Liquidation Value**|**$17.78**|**$12.50**|**$22.50**|\n|**EV/EBITDA Valuation**|**$12.30**|**$9.75**|**$15.00**|\n|**P/E Valuation (12x Earnings)**|**$11.35**|**$8.50**|**$13.50**|\n|**Current Market Price**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|\n\n📌 **Our target price of $18.50 is based on a blended DCF and sum-of-the-parts valuation.**\n\n# 1. Company Overview & Strategic Pivot\n\nKodak operates across **four primary segments**:\n\n1. **Print & Imaging (55% of 2024 revenue)**\n   * Declining legacy business, but Kodak is stabilizing margins at **20% gross margin**.\n2. **Advanced Materials & Chemicals (22%)**\n   * High-margin segment (**27% EBITDA margin**) that supplies key specialty chemicals.\n3. **Brand Licensing & Real Estate (10%)**\n   * Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP), a 1,200-acre industrial park** undervalued on the balance sheet.\n4. **Pharmaceuticals (13% by 2025)**\n   * New revenue driver, projected to **generate $149M in 2025 with 35% margins**.\n\nKodak’s **pharmaceutical expansion** is the primary catalyst for **margin improvement and revenue diversification**. With **government incentives supporting domestic drug manufacturing**, Kodak is well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\n# 2.

Key Catalysts & Upside Drivers\n\n# 3.1 Pension Surplus & Debt Reduction\n\n* Kodak **will use $315M in pension assets to reduce debt**, lowering interest costs by **$25M annually**.\n* **Net debt will decline to $145M, reducing leverage to 0.7x EBITDA.**\n* This **significantly increases Free Cash Flow (FCF) starting in 2025**.\n\n# 3.2 Pharma Division Launch in 2025\n\n* Kodak’s **API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) manufacturing facility** is near completion.\n* The pharma sector offers **30%-40% gross margins**, significantly higher than print.\n* **Government incentives for domestic API production could drive contract wins.**\n* **Projected revenue: $149M in 2025 → $250M by 2029.**\n\n# 3.3 Trade Tariff Tailwinds\n\n* **Trump’s trade policies favor U.S. manufacturers** in specialty chemicals and pharma.\n* Tariffs on **Chinese imports** could make Kodak’s products **more competitive**.\n* **Kodak is well-positioned as a U.S.-based supplier**.\n\n# 3.4 Real Estate Monetization - Hidden Value in EBP\n\n* **Eastman Business Park (EBP)** is worth **$175M-$200M**, but it’s booked at **$60M**.\n* Leasing out or **selling portions of EBP could unlock value**.\n\n# 4. Investment Risks & Mitigation\n\n|**Risk Factor**|**Impact**|**Mitigation Strategy**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Declining Print Business**|Print revenue declining 5% YoY.|**high-margin Pharma & Chemicals**Focus on  .|\n|**Execution Risk in Pharma**|Regulatory or contract issues.|**Target pre-signed API supply contracts**.|\n|**Supply Chain & Tariff Risks**|Cost increases from import tariffs.|**Domestic manufacturing advantage** offsets risk.|\n\n# 5. Conclusion: A Deep Value Play\n\nKodak presents a **compelling risk-reward opportunity** driven by:\n\n1. **Pharma division launch in 2025** (high-margin growth engine).\n2. **Debt reduction through pension surplus**, boosting FCF.\n3. **Hidden real estate value in Eastman Business Park**.\n4. **Trade tailwinds under Trump favoring domestic manufacturing**.\n\n📌 **Rating: Overweight**  \n📌 **Target Price: $18.50** (172% upside)\n\nKodak is a **highly asymmetric deep-value opportunity** with significant potential for re-rating in 2025. 🚀\n\n\n\n# ELI5: Why Kodak is a Good Investment Right Now 📈\n\nImagine you have **an old company like Kodak**, which used to make cameras and films. People think it’s outdated, but here’s the **secret**—Kodak is quietly transforming into something much bigger. And **Wall Street isn’t paying attention yet**.\n\nHere’s why **smart investors** might want to take a closer look at Kodak:\n\n# 1️⃣ Kodak Is Getting Into Pharmaceuticals (Drugs 💊)\n\n* Kodak is **building a factory** to make ingredients for medicines.\n* This **new business starts in 2025** and will make **a lot more money per dollar spent** than selling old-school film and prints.\n* Think of it like Kodak **switching from selling DVDs to streaming movies—it’s the future!**\n* **This new drug business could bring in over $250M a year** in just a few years.\n\n# 2️⃣ Kodak Is Paying Off a TON of Debt 💰\n\n* Kodak had **a special pension fund with $1.08 BILLION** saved up.\n* They will use **$315M to pay down debt**, meaning they **don’t have to pay as much interest anymore**.\n* **This frees up an extra $25M per year!**\n* Less debt = **stronger company + more money to grow the business**.\n\n# 3️⃣ Hidden Gold Mine: Kodak Owns a HUGE Industrial Park 🏭\n\n* Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP)**, a **1,200-acre** industrial site.\n* Right now, it’s on the books for **only $60M**, but it’s actually worth **$175M+**.\n* If they **sell or rent out more space**, Kodak could **make a lot of extra money**.\n\n# 4️⃣ The Government Might Help Kodak (Trump's Trade Policies 🇺🇸)\n\n* The U.S. **wants to make more stuff at home** (like medicine and tech parts).\n* Kodak **makes things in America**, which means **they could get government support** and win new contracts.\n* If new tariffs (taxes on foreign goods) happen, Kodak’s **U.S.-made products become more valuable**.\n\n# 5️⃣ Kodak’s Stock Is TOO CHEAP 📉\n\n📌 **Right now, Kodak is trading at $6.79 per share.**  \n📌 **Experts say it should be worth between $11.50 - $24.00 per share!**  \n📌 That means the stock **could DOUBLE or even TRIPLE** in price.\n\n# 💡 What’s Next?\n\nKodak is **no longer just an “old camera company.”** With **pharma, real estate, and smart debt moves**, it **could become a big winner** in the next couple of years.\n\n✅ **New drug business = more profits**  \n✅ **Less debt = more cash to grow**  \n✅ **Hidden assets = even more value**  \n✅ **Government policies = possible tailwinds**\n\n**Right now, Wall Street isn’t paying attention… but soon, they might.** 🚀 \n\n\n\nSources:  \n[https://investor.kodak.com/financial-information/sec-filings](https://investor.kodak.com/financial-information/sec-filings)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-pharmaceutical-ingredient-factory-nearing-completion/amp/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-pharmaceutical-ingredient-factory-nearing-completion/amp/)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-prepares-to-terminate-u-s-pension-book-gain-of-more-than-500-million-d0cfb621](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-prepares-to-terminate-u-s-pension-book-gain-of-more-than-500-million-d0cfb621)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-looks-to-terminate-us-pensions-will-gain-over-500-million-in-finances/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-looks-to-terminate-us-pensions-will-gain-over-500-million-in-finances/)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-increases-film-production-capacity-to-meet-commercial-consumer-demand/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-increases-film-production-capacity-to-meet-commercial-consumer-demand/)  \n  \n[https://www.alcircle.com/news/kodak-s-call-for-tariffs-answered-us-to-impose-hefty-duties-on-imported-aluminium-printing-plates-112353?srsltid=AfmBOoqcAD-pC6yafn8auf4oN60aQaPUrgDLx2vh3zrUHHJyXT-TQNqx](https://www.alcircle.com/news/kodak-s-call-for-tariffs-answered-us-to-impose-hefty-duties-on-imported-aluminium-printing-plates-112353?srsltid=AfmBOoqcAD-pC6yafn8auf4oN60aQaPUrgDLx2vh3zrUHHJyXT-TQNqx)  \n\n\nBonus, real life DD:  \n  \nI did not know, but check how active are the Kodak clients/fans on other subredits there are literally dozens of posts each day including the word \"Kodak\".   \nAlso, the 90s are trendy these days, it is not unusual to see Gen Z youngsters with analogic cameras.",

        "original_text": "Hi regards. Since markets are closed today and we're all bored as fuck, I'm gonna drop some insight on all y'all that want to gamble away your mortgages and college tuitions.\n\nWe've seen a few trends over the last few months where some previously-beat-up tickers went from trash to gold. I'm gonna call this trend \"shit we thought we'd have in the future because we watched a lot of sci-fi movies\". 2024 was the year of AI, then it was the space stocks (RKLB, LUNR, etc). Then it was the flying car stocks (ARCH, JOBY, etc). Then we all saw the quantum stock bubble (though any regard with a CS degree could have told you the same thing that Jensen did). So, what sci-fi future shit is left to invest in? Robots, obviously!\n\nExcept, robots, like space rockets, are real. And they're already in market and getting better rapidly. 2025 is the year when they'll really start to go mainstream, largely because software is the biggest limiting factor to how good robots are today. With recent advancements in AI, robots are going to start getting \\*A LOT\\* better.\n\nFurther supporting my bullish thesis is NVIDIA's recent release of their Cosmos Wold Foundation Model  (https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-cosmos-world-foundation-model-platform-to-accelerate-physical-ai-development). Why is this a big deal? because, this will really lower the cost of entry for the robot manufacturers as they won't have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to train a vision model by themselves. Now they can just equip their bots with some commodity sensors & cameras and build out the hardware bot for their use case.\n\nPositions:\n\nDue to market-cap requirements here, the only one I can mention is SERV - holding 2000 shares and 20 LEAP contracts for May.\n\nI have a bag of bunch of other tickers in the space that have a 250-500M valuation.",
