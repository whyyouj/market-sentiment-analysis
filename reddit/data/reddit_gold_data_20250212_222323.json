With SHFE gold futures breaking out, the possibility of rising trading volumes, and the return of a Chinese gold price premium, the conditions for another bullish episode are falling into place. China’s economic crisis, record-low bond yields, and the looming prospect of massive stimulus only strengthen the case for gold’s continued ascent. Meanwhile, the PBOC’s renewed gold purchases, alongside this new insurance-gold-purchasing pilot program reinforce the broader shift toward gold as a preferred asset\n\nIf these factors align as expected, the next phase of this bull market could be even more dramatic than what we saw in 2024.From zero hedge.",

        "text": "Ongoing Gold & Silver Short Squeeze Continues\nFebruary 6 (King World News) – James Turk:  The new year has opened with a bang, Eric, and I expect the good news for gold and silver bulls to continue — provided you own physical metal, which means we need to discuss this ongoing squeeze of short positions in gold and silver that is receiving a lot of media attention. \n\nTariffs are being bandied about as the cause, but I think there is more to it because it is not logical or profitable to delay delivery on short positions.\n\nDecades ago when I first started trading futures, deliveries by the shorts were made on or near what is called First Notice Day. It is always advantageous for the shorts to deliver as soon as possible, but they have to wait for FND. These dates are announced by Comex years in advance.\n\nThe shorts want to deliver because they want to get rid of the metal they sold in advance through futures or forwards and get paid for the metal they are selling. Those dollars they receive from the sale/delivery could then be spent or invested to earn interest, so there is no reason to hold off on meeting their delivery obligation. \n\nAlso, once the metal is delivered, the buyer now pays the metal’s storage. That cost savings is another advantage for the shorts to deliver as soon as possible on or immediately after FND. And that’s the way it works in normal markets. \n\nSo the delays to deliver physical metal – which news reports are saying is several weeks – is not normal. But it is not tariffs that are causing these distortions in my view. \n\nIt’s happening because there are vastly more promises to deliver gold than there is physical metal available at current prices, and maybe even more promises than there is existent gold. The same is true for silver. \n\nConsider this comment in London’s Financial Times. The flow physical of physical metal out of London to New York:\n\n“is causing disruption to the gold market, and has increased the cost of borrowing gold.”\n\nLet’s unpack this sentence. If you are short gold and need to deliver, you must deliver. If you don’t, you default, which could put you or your business if you are a dealer into bankruptcy. That’s what happened to Volume Investors back in 1985, but its collapse was an isolated event with limited knock-on affect.\n\nVolume Investors failed to deliver cash on a margin call, but dollars can be easily borrowed if you are creditworthy (Volume Investors wasn’t). Banks create dollars when they make a loan, but banks cannot conjure up physical gold and silver. So metals have to be borrowed from existent stock, and the shorts are discovering that physical metal is being held by strong hands unwilling to lend their gold – even at these abnormally high interest rates – because they don’t want to take the risk of dealer defaults and never seeing their gold again.\n\nBut there is also another type of strong hands. It is the holders of physical metal unwilling to sell at current prices because they expect prices to rise much further. It’s the same thing that happened in the 1930s. People moved their purchasing power (money) out of banks into paper currency initially, and then as those promises became doubted, out of dollars into gold. The fractional reserve system of more gold promises than existent physical metal is contracting. \n\nSo the shorts have a serious problem, Eric, that is apparent in this gold chart. \n\nKing World News note: The lack of available physical gold has kept pullbacks in the gold market very shallow, despite the blistering upside move from $1,800 to $2,900\n\n\n\nGold had been stair-stepping higher throughout 2024 until a brief shakeout in November. That drop was probably engineered by the shorts because they knew what was coming. So they were no doubt hoping to pick up some physical metal before getting squeezed, which began in earnest during December deliveries.\n\nThat month the shorts – namely the dealers – discovered that it was a hard sell to convince buyers to roll their position into some London paper gold scheme, even when offered enticing rates. Since December the squeeze on shorts has tightened, and as the chart shows, gold is rocketing higher.Written by James Turk.",

        "text": "Today Nomi Prins, who has given keynote speeches to the IMF, Federal Reserve and World Bank, told King World News that the price of gold was set to surge another $2,000+ from current levels. She also discussed her predictions for price of silver and much more.\n\nFebruary 8 (King World News) – Eric King:  “Nomi, we were laughing before we kicked off this interview about how we sounded, I don’t want to call us a couple of lunatics, and I’m going back close to the lows in gold when the price was around $1,800 and silver was near $20, and the HUI was below 200, and for weeks after that on King World News I began telling people all over the world — That’s it, we’ve bottomed! These things (gold, silver, miners) are out of here, and we’re going to new all-time highs on gold, new all-time highs on silver, we’re going to new all-time highs on the HUI. And that sounded crazy, but gold is already there, silver is at $33, the HUI is picking up some steam, but the HUI could really start to get some momentum and get up to 525 as soon as it breaks 375. Then the index will be a stone’s throw from all-time highs.\n\nAnd you were predicting $40 silver when it was in the abyss and people thought you were, I don’t want to say crazy (Nomi laughs) but I think people have a hard time getting their arms around predictions like that. You also called for the price of gold to hit $2,500 at the end of 2023. That was accurate. Then you predicted $3,000 gold, $40 silver. We are almost at $3,000 gold, we’re closing in on $40 silver. Do you ever have any of your friends reach out to you and say, ‘Nomi, you were right. I thought you were crazy but you were right.’\n\nNomi Prins:  “I do because they were asking, ‘Why are you so into gold and silver?’ And from the beginning of when I looked at silver coins and bought them every single year for my nephews and nieces birthday presents I was telling them ‘Silver is a physical asset, gold is a physical asset. They represent wealth, they represent money, they represent longevity, they represent history.’\n\nBut I’m really more excited about gold than I’ve been when I was calling it to be at $3,000 at the turn of 2024/2025, or $4,000 in a year, or over $5,000 in two years because we are in a moment where all of these reasons have come together to push gold up. If I look at all of the math, and I ran these numbers — and I am a geek, you know this, Eric, I started as a math person, it’s in my blood — any which way I run all of the numbers, (the price of) gold goes over…to continue listening to Nomi Prins’s remarkable predictions for the price of gold, silver, mining stocks, uranium and much more.",

        "text": "I’ve been hearing a lot about the Chinese economy having issues, particularly their falling population is going to have a big effect on their real estate market in the next decade. Apparently the Chinese invest very heavy in real estate getting second homes and things like that to preserve and build wealth instead of getting in stock markets, this is fine when real estate goes up but when the population is declining & real estate prices are projected to fall massively cause of the population decline I’m wondering if more Chinese are throwing money into gold rather than real estate. \nIn my layman thinking, it makes sense that the Chinese would buy gold to preserve their wealth when they can’t trust their stock markets or real estate. \nGold like everything else is at the mercy of supply and demand, and if you have a culture like china that is more prone to saving, and you have hundreds of millions of people in that culture buying gold rather than real estate you might end up in a scenario like now where gold is having crazy gains, way above just regular inflation. \nI’m just wondering if this huge price, almost 3000 an oz is more like a bubble and is based more on huge demand coming from hundreds of millions rather than just simply gold following inflation. \nGold is up 41% in the past year.. that’s multiples above inflation.

Previous premiums and discounts — driven by central bank trading activity — have generally been no more than a few tens of cents per ounce, traders said.\n\n\nThe disconnect comes as traders worldwide rush to get gold to the US ahead of the potential imposition of tariffs and to capture premium prices. US President Donald Trump hasn’t targeted precious metals specifically as he ratchets up his trade war, but dealers are worried they could be included in blanket tariffs that he’s threatened.\n\n\nThe BOE holds more than 400,000 gold bars, worth over $450 billion at current prices, largely on behalf of other central banks, but also for a few key gold dealers. That’s only a portion of the more than 8,000 tons of gold stored in London, according to LBMA data, but much of that is owned by exchange-traded funds, central banks, and other investors who may not wish to sell. \n\n\nWith traders racing against the clock, staff at the Bank of England are struggling to keep up, and growing queues are making the gold in its vault less attractive than bullion held in more accessible commercial vaults around London. \n\n\nPrices for gold on New York’s Comex surged over international benchmarks in recent months, as traders closed out short positions for fear of being hit with tariffs by President Donald Trump’s administration. Those spreads have since come down, but freely available gold remains in tight supply in London as traders who sold futures at the high prices seek to secure metal to deliver on their commitments.\n\n\nGold in the Bank of England vault is trading at a discount to the wider market, as fears over potential Trump tariffs spark a scramble for bullion that’s resulting in weeks-long queues to withdraw metal.\n\n\nThe tightness can be seen in one-month lease rates for bullion, which have jumped to about 4.7%, far above the usual level of close to zero. The rate reflects the return that holders of bullion in London’s vaults can get by loaning their metal out on a short-term basis.\n\n\n",

I sold it for a down-payment on a house, so I can't be too upset. I've now bought and sold a lot of gold and have some decent regional advice:\n\nAdvice for UK buyers:\n\n- UK gold is what you should buy. I bought Napoleons,  Libertads and others not in this photo. Trust me, if you're selling bullion in the UK, they don't matter. They're beautiful but you're you're going to lose.\n\n- Sovereigns by year don't matter for bullion prices. Any year will be the same value. Same for any Britannia. It's bullion, not Numismatic value.\n\n- If you want to buy coins by year, type, karate, they're a lot harder to sell. If you buy them because you like them, fine. But you won't get anything more than bullion value.\n\n- If you're strict with your purchase, just buy sovereigns and Britannias. They're treated the same at a bullion seller/buyer even if they then sell your coins at a greater type value.\n\n- Most importantly, decide whether you're a coin collector or an investor. If you're an investor, only buy best value. If you're after coins you like, fine. Just know that you'll need to find a place to sell them.\n\nI am now starting again, with a single sovereign. I'll once again build. Happy Hoarding.",

Previously, I sourced my bullion from local coin shops. However, upon discovering Costco’s competitive pricing on gold bullion, I transitioned to ordering directly from Costco.com.\n\nCostco.com’s premiums on gold bullion ranged from 1.5% to a slightly over 2%. During the final two months of last year, I actively purchased gold bullion from Costco.com due to its lowest premium among gold bullion retailers. I regularly monitored their app to ascertain the availability of the 2025 American Gold Buffalo, as I rarely encountered this particular gold bullion in stock. A couple of days ago, it was available for $2,849.99, with a premium of only 1.7%. However, just as I was about to complete the purchase, the item became unavailable.\n\nSubsequently, the 2025 American Gold Buffalo returned to stock. However, the price had increased to $2,939.99, resulting in a premium of 5.1%. This represents a substantial increase compared to the previous 1.7% premium. I am intrigued by the reason behind this significant price hike that is equivalent to a 200% increase in premium.",

I also saw tarrifs would cause lots of inflation, which is generally considered good for gold prices. Are there any blind spots in my analysis?\n\nAlso, since products from Canada exported into the United States incurs a tarrifs, could the gold and silver from Canada be devalued compared to the gold and silver in the US?

On the last trading day, gold briefly broke above the $2800 level but ultimately closed below it.  \n\n🔍 Market Psychology Insight:  \nA significant number of retail traders have been heavily positioned on the buy side since the beginning of the year—not just near the all-time high, but consistently throughout January. This aligns with the typical New Year psychology, where fresh capital enters the market, and the majority tends to favor buying.  \n\n⚠️ Overbought Conditions & Liquidity Traps:  \nI see a considerable amount of retail stop-loss liquidity in the market, indicating that gold is currently in an overbought zone and in need of a strong correction.  \n\n📆 Monday's Market Expectation:  \nI anticipate another breakout attempt above $2800, likely triggering further retail buying, as traders perceive it as the first bullish move of February. However, my focus will be on targeting those stop-loss levels, as I remain bearish on gold in the near term.  \n\n📉 Bearish Outlook Moving Forward:  \nAs long as gold remains below January’s monthly candle high, my overall bias remains bearish. While my long-term target on the sell side is extensive, market conditions will dictate the strategy moving forward.  \n\n✅ January was a highly successful trading month!

        "text": "If you’ve spent any time in the world of gold and silver, you’ve probably noticed there are *distinct* personalities in this space. Whether you’re at a coin shop, a Reddit thread, or a gold convention, chances are you’ve run into all four of these types:\n\n# 🪙 Type 1: The Sound Money Purist (a.k.a. “Gold is Real Money” Guy)\n\nThese folks don’t just stack gold—they *preach* it. To them, **gold and silver are the only real money**. Everything else? Fake. Fiat currency? A scam. The Federal Reserve? A Ponzi scheme. Their dream? **Bringing back the gold standard and watching fiat burn.** They likely own a copy of *The Creature from Jekyll Island*, have strong opinions on central banking, and believe that every economic collapse is just one step closer to their “I told you so” moment.\n\n# 💰 Type 2: The Hardcore Stacker (“Premiums? I’d Rather Die”)\n\nFor this person, **gold is wealth preservation**, plain and simple. They’re here to **protect their purchasing power**, not start a revolution. They’re laser-focused on **weight, spot price, and premiums**—and if you overpaid by even a few bucks, trust me, they’ll let you know. To them, **gold is gold**—doesn’t matter if it’s a Maple Leaf, a Krugerrand, or a scratched-up bar with bite marks from the last guy who tested it. If it’s the cheapest per ounce, it’s **good enough**.\n\n# 🧐 Type 3: The Numismatist (“Yes, But Is It Rare?”)\n\nThey’re not just stacking metal—they’re **hunting treasure**. This person loves the thrill of **finding rare coins, limited mintages, and historical pieces**. They’ll gladly pay **10x spot price** if it means securing a **low-population MS-70 from a forgotten 19th-century mint**. They obsess over coin grading, mint errors, and market trends, and while you’re hoarding bullion, they’re out here flipping **high-premium rarities** for insane profits—or holding onto them as *future* grail pieces.\n\n# ✨ Type 4: The Gold Aestheticist (“It’s Just Beautiful, Okay?”)\n\nSome people stack gold for its monetary value—these people stack it because **it’s stunning**. They don’t care about premiums, numismatics, or economic theories. They just love **gold**—the weight, the shine, the sheer beauty of it. Maybe they collect jewelry, maybe they just like to admire their coins under perfect lighting. Either way, their stack isn’t just an investment, it’s a **work of art**.\n\n**So, which one are you?** Or are you a mix of a few? No matter where you fall, we’re all here for the love of gold—whether it’s for wealth, history, security, or just pure admiration. **Drop a comment and tell us your type!** 🏆💰✨",

With SHFE gold futures breaking out, the possibility of rising trading volumes, and the return of a Chinese gold price premium, the conditions for another bullish episode are falling into place. China’s economic crisis, record-low bond yields, and the looming prospect of massive stimulus only strengthen the case for gold’s continued ascent. Meanwhile, the PBOC’s renewed gold purchases, alongside this new insurance-gold-purchasing pilot program reinforce the broader shift toward gold as a preferred asset\n\nIf these factors align as expected, the next phase of this bull market could be even more dramatic than what we saw in 2024.From zero hedge.",

        "text": "Hi everybody! Just looking for some insight on a subject I couldn’t find many recent threads on.\n\nMy partner and I are in the process of starting a brick and mortar “cash for gold” business in the heart of downtown of a 2.5M population American city who’s main industry is tourism. We’ve applied for all the necessary licenses and permits, have sufficient liquid assets to bankroll our startup, have purchased a portable XRF machine (Thermo Fisher Niton XL2), own the property and office space outright where our business will be located, etc.\n\nWhat is the viability of this type of business in 2025? From what little I’ve read on this, I know that marketing is probably the biggest factor in terms of who is successful and who is not. We plan on heavily marketing the business online using pay-per-click ad campaigns. We’ve designed our location to be very competitive as far as attracting customers. For example: our central downtown location will be built into an existing Criminal Defense law firm. 95% of that firm’s clients pay cash up front to retain representation for their legal matters. The idea is to offer the gold buying service as a financing option to clients who might otherwise have to obtain money from their friends or family in order to hire an attorney.\n\nAs I said earlier, we will also be investing in other marketing options to reach potential new clients, especially (if not exclusively) online.\n\nAs far as security is concerned, we are taking a small private office located inside the law firm and converting it to be a secure space complete with bulletproof wall panels, a walk-up “bank teller” style window with adequate ballistic glass for handling all transactions, and a controlled entry ballistic grade door. Cameras are already installed at various positions throughout the entire law office building and additional cameras will be installed to cover the secure office space where the gold/cash transactions will occur. Inside the 12x10 foot secure room will be the XRF machine, a computer and printer, a large safe, scales, etc. Also of major note is the fact that two, armed security guards patrol the law building during business hours and, once we open for business, one of the guards’ duties will be tailored to patrol and oversee primarily the law office’s reception area and the controlled access hallway leading up to the bank-style teller window and C4G office door. Keep in mind that there are about 100 law office personnel working in offices within the same building as the cash for gold office.\n\nWhat am I missing? Any advice as to equipment, additional security measures, marketing?\n\nThere are two competing cash for gold locations within 1-2 blocks of us. One is a pawnshop.\n\nThanks in advance for your attention and advice!",

        "text": "Ongoing Gold & Silver Short Squeeze Continues\nFebruary 6 (King World News) – James Turk:  The new year has opened with a bang, Eric, and I expect the good news for gold and silver bulls to continue — provided you own physical metal, which means we need to discuss this ongoing squeeze of short positions in gold and silver that is receiving a lot of media attention. \n\nTariffs are being bandied about as the cause, but I think there is more to it because it is not logical or profitable to delay delivery on short positions.\n\nDecades ago when I first started trading futures, deliveries by the shorts were made on or near what is called First Notice Day. It is always advantageous for the shorts to deliver as soon as possible, but they have to wait for FND. These dates are announced by Comex years in advance.\n\nThe shorts want to deliver because they want to get rid of the metal they sold in advance through futures or forwards and get paid for the metal they are selling. Those dollars they receive from the sale/delivery could then be spent or invested to earn interest, so there is no reason to hold off on meeting their delivery obligation. \n\nAlso, once the metal is delivered, the buyer now pays the metal’s storage. That cost savings is another advantage for the shorts to deliver as soon as possible on or immediately after FND. And that’s the way it works in normal markets. \n\nSo the delays to deliver physical metal – which news reports are saying is several weeks – is not normal. But it is not tariffs that are causing these distortions in my view. \n\nIt’s happening because there are vastly more promises to deliver gold than there is physical metal available at current prices, and maybe even more promises than there is existent gold. The same is true for silver. \n\nConsider this comment in London’s Financial Times. The flow physical of physical metal out of London to New York:\n\n“is causing disruption to the gold market, and has increased the cost of borrowing gold.”\n\nLet’s unpack this sentence. If you are short gold and need to deliver, you must deliver. If you don’t, you default, which could put you or your business if you are a dealer into bankruptcy. That’s what happened to Volume Investors back in 1985, but its collapse was an isolated event with limited knock-on affect.\n\nVolume Investors failed to deliver cash on a margin call, but dollars can be easily borrowed if you are creditworthy (Volume Investors wasn’t). Banks create dollars when they make a loan, but banks cannot conjure up physical gold and silver. So metals have to be borrowed from existent stock, and the shorts are discovering that physical metal is being held by strong hands unwilling to lend their gold – even at these abnormally high interest rates – because they don’t want to take the risk of dealer defaults and never seeing their gold again.\n\nBut there is also another type of strong hands. It is the holders of physical metal unwilling to sell at current prices because they expect prices to rise much further. It’s the same thing that happened in the 1930s. People moved their purchasing power (money) out of banks into paper currency initially, and then as those promises became doubted, out of dollars into gold. The fractional reserve system of more gold promises than existent physical metal is contracting. \n\nSo the shorts have a serious problem, Eric, that is apparent in this gold chart. \n\nKing World News note: The lack of available physical gold has kept pullbacks in the gold market very shallow, despite the blistering upside move from $1,800 to $2,900\n\n\n\nGold had been stair-stepping higher throughout 2024 until a brief shakeout in November. That drop was probably engineered by the shorts because they knew what was coming. So they were no doubt hoping to pick up some physical metal before getting squeezed, which began in earnest during December deliveries.\n\nThat month the shorts – namely the dealers – discovered that it was a hard sell to convince buyers to roll their position into some London paper gold scheme, even when offered enticing rates. Since December the squeeze on shorts has tightened, and as the chart shows, gold is rocketing higher.Written by James Turk.",

        "text": "I’ve been hearing a lot about the Chinese economy having issues, particularly their falling population is going to have a big effect on their real estate market in the next decade. Apparently the Chinese invest very heavy in real estate getting second homes and things like that to preserve and build wealth instead of getting in stock markets, this is fine when real estate goes up but when the population is declining & real estate prices are projected to fall massively cause of the population decline I’m wondering if more Chinese are throwing money into gold rather than real estate. \nIn my layman thinking, it makes sense that the Chinese would buy gold to preserve their wealth when they can’t trust their stock markets or real estate. \nGold like everything else is at the mercy of supply and demand, and if you have a culture like china that is more prone to saving, and you have hundreds of millions of people in that culture buying gold rather than real estate you might end up in a scenario like now where gold is having crazy gains, way above just regular inflation. \nI’m just wondering if this huge price, almost 3000 an oz is more like a bubble and is based more on huge demand coming from hundreds of millions rather than just simply gold following inflation. \nGold is up 41% in the past year.. that’s multiples above inflation.

Given inflation risks, U.S. Treasuries probably aren’t the best choice for a safe haven, while foreign-exchange markets will continue to be roiled by trade headlines, he wrote.\n\nBeyond the near-term risk of a selloff to cover losses in equity markets, the tariffs reinforce the medium-term bull case for gold, JPMorgan analysts said in a note.\n\nTrump’s tariffs point to a much more disruptive policy approach with increased economic growth concerns and higher inflation risks, all boosting gold’s hedge appeal, JPM said.",

On the last trading day, gold briefly broke above the $2800 level but ultimately closed below it.  \n\n🔍 Market Psychology Insight:  \nA significant number of retail traders have been heavily positioned on the buy side since the beginning of the year—not just near the all-time high, but consistently throughout January. This aligns with the typical New Year psychology, where fresh capital enters the market, and the majority tends to favor buying.  \n\n⚠️ Overbought Conditions & Liquidity Traps:  \nI see a considerable amount of retail stop-loss liquidity in the market, indicating that gold is currently in an overbought zone and in need of a strong correction.  \n\n📆 Monday's Market Expectation:  \nI anticipate another breakout attempt above $2800, likely triggering further retail buying, as traders perceive it as the first bullish move of February. However, my focus will be on targeting those stop-loss levels, as I remain bearish on gold in the near term.  \n\n📉 Bearish Outlook Moving Forward:  \nAs long as gold remains below January’s monthly candle high, my overall bias remains bearish. While my long-term target on the sell side is extensive, market conditions will dictate the strategy moving forward.  \n\n✅ January was a highly successful trading month!

        "text": "If you’ve spent any time in the world of gold and silver, you’ve probably noticed there are *distinct* personalities in this space. Whether you’re at a coin shop, a Reddit thread, or a gold convention, chances are you’ve run into all four of these types:\n\n# 🪙 Type 1: The Sound Money Purist (a.k.a. “Gold is Real Money” Guy)\n\nThese folks don’t just stack gold—they *preach* it. To them, **gold and silver are the only real money**. Everything else? Fake. Fiat currency? A scam. The Federal Reserve? A Ponzi scheme. Their dream? **Bringing back the gold standard and watching fiat burn.** They likely own a copy of *The Creature from Jekyll Island*, have strong opinions on central banking, and believe that every economic collapse is just one step closer to their “I told you so” moment.\n\n# 💰 Type 2: The Hardcore Stacker (“Premiums? I’d Rather Die”)\n\nFor this person, **gold is wealth preservation**, plain and simple. They’re here to **protect their purchasing power**, not start a revolution. They’re laser-focused on **weight, spot price, and premiums**—and if you overpaid by even a few bucks, trust me, they’ll let you know. To them, **gold is gold**—doesn’t matter if it’s a Maple Leaf, a Krugerrand, or a scratched-up bar with bite marks from the last guy who tested it. If it’s the cheapest per ounce, it’s **good enough**.\n\n# 🧐 Type 3: The Numismatist (“Yes, But Is It Rare?”)\n\nThey’re not just stacking metal—they’re **hunting treasure**. This person loves the thrill of **finding rare coins, limited mintages, and historical pieces**. They’ll gladly pay **10x spot price** if it means securing a **low-population MS-70 from a forgotten 19th-century mint**. They obsess over coin grading, mint errors, and market trends, and while you’re hoarding bullion, they’re out here flipping **high-premium rarities** for insane profits—or holding onto them as *future* grail pieces.\n\n# ✨ Type 4: The Gold Aestheticist (“It’s Just Beautiful, Okay?”)\n\nSome people stack gold for its monetary value—these people stack it because **it’s stunning**. They don’t care about premiums, numismatics, or economic theories. They just love **gold**—the weight, the shine, the sheer beauty of it. Maybe they collect jewelry, maybe they just like to admire their coins under perfect lighting. Either way, their stack isn’t just an investment, it’s a **work of art**.\n\n**So, which one are you?** Or are you a mix of a few? No matter where you fall, we’re all here for the love of gold—whether it’s for wealth, history, security, or just pure admiration. **Drop a comment and tell us your type!** 🏆💰✨",

In all likelihood though it’ll become uneconomical before that since the “last mile” is always most expensive. \n\nOf course that’s just the “new” gold entering the market. I’ve seen estimates that about 200,000 tons have already been extracted. And we all know it can be recycled. \n\nSo what will happen when the gold mines stop mining? Do we expect the spot price to go through the roof or not?",

What do you guys think of a product like this? Is it worth it? Have any of you ever had experience with it?\n\n_Here's what the bank says about this account:_\nGold can be held in a metals account as a precious metal balance (XAU). The high liquidity of the foreign exchange market enables fast and cost-effective transactions between the precious metal and other currencies. In principle, it is possible to convert the credit balance into physical metal, but this entails costs.\n\nPremium/spread (excl. stamp duty/commission):\n0.03%-1.00%\n\nAdministration fees per year:\n0.20%\n\nThank you and appreciate the advice!",

Borrowers include jewellery manufacturing groups, miners and ...those who are shorting the market (they borrow gold to sell it in the expectation that prices will fall, where they make a profit). But if the cost of borrowing gold goes through the roof … as it has ... then that trade can get deeply unattractive and expensive very quickly. \n\nInter-bank gold lease rates are typically sub 0.5% while market counterparts could pay between 1% to 3% pa depending upon credit worthiness. Well interbank borrowing costs for 1 to 3 months perioods recently rose to a peak of about 12%. That hurts. \n\nSo that's what we have today … and that takes us back to New York. Speculators who have been running a leveraged short gold position are closing out these bets by buying gold because it is expensive to run (and likely taking a loss) … and hence the price rally. Everything is connected. \n\nWe estimate that so far 280 tonnes of gold has been flown from London to New York in the last month – so between 50 to 60 flights will have been carrying the metal into CME registered vaults to fill the demand. If no tariffs, then likely that metal will come home to London over the next few months. It's once again time to start sharing the good news about gold .

I hope this information helps anyone looking to better understand the world of physical gold trading.\n\nHere are some key things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Verification is Crucial:** Whether you’re buying or selling, always ensure you’re working with a licensed and reputable entity. Verifying documentation like Intent Letters and proof of funds can go a long way in ensuring secure transactions.\n2. **Gold Specifications to Know:** High-quality gold bullion typically comes in 22, 23, or 24 karats with a fineness of 96%-97%. Knowing these details helps you understand what you’re buying or selling.\n3. **Transparency in Pricing:** In bulk transactions, competitive pricing is common, with large deals often negotiated at rates below market value. It’s important to stay informed about current market rates and pricing structures.\n4. **Shipping and Logistics:** Shipping gold involves significant logistical challenges. Make sure you understand the taxation rules in your country, as this can affect where and how the gold is shipped.\n\nI’m curious to hear how others in this community navigate the complexities of gold transactions. What processes or best practices do you rely on to ensure a safe and secure experience?\n\nLet’s share knowledge and make gold trading safer for everyone!",

I’m curious: **How do you approach negotiating prices on gold jewelry, and what tactics have worked for you?**\n\nFor instance:\n\n* Have you ever successfully negotiated at a local jeweler or even at chain stores?\n* Do certain cultural or regional norms influence how people haggle for gold jewelry?\n* If you had a tool that could calculate a “fair market value” price, do you think it would boost your bargaining power?\n\n**Backstory:** I got frustrated feeling like I was overpaying, so I started tinkering with an AI tool that calculates fair prices for gold jewelry based on karats, weight, real-time gold rates, and typical labor markups. It’s helped me feel more confident in negotiations—but I’d love to hear real-world perspectives before I go too deep into the AI side of things.\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n1. Do you have any rule-of-thumb for spotting overpriced pieces?\n2. Have you ever walked away from a deal because of a suspected markup?\n3. Would real-time price references or an AI “fair price” suggestion change how you shop?\n\nI’m excited to hear your thoughts—especially if you’ve got any gold-buying success stories or cautionary tales to share.

Over time, as I can work during the summer or earn a more stable income, I hope to increase my budget for both the stock market and gold. I believe that over the long term, this could create a snowball effect.\n\nWhat are the best coins for someone with my budget? I’ve heard that Napoleons are popular, but are there other options I should consider?\n\nShould I focus on coins or small gold bars, and why?\n\nAre there things I should prioritize or avoid (e.g., certain types of coins, specific sellers, etc.)?\n\nAny advice on where to buy gold safely and with reasonable fees, especially for small amounts like mine?\n\n\nI’m looking to build something for the long term, so any advice or tips that could help me avoid beginner mistakes would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for your help and suggestions!",

        "text": "Recently Yves Smith from Naked Capitalism published an article by Richard Murphy making the case that [Governments should not hold BitCoin](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/01/should-the-government-be-allowed-to-hold-bitcoin.html).  I wrote a reply to the effect that the word bitcoin could be replaced everywhere in the article with the word gold and the article would have a much different slant.  I thought I would post my reply here both to generate discussion and to preserve my thoughts as Dr. Smith has shut off the comments section. She may yet decide to delete all my comments. I hope I wasn't directly responsible for that.  \n\nHere is what I wrote:  \n\n\n\n>  I did a little exercise of replacing all instances of bitcoin with gold in the above text. I was going to paste it here but I’m pretty sure nobody will read it. Maybe you can explain to me how gold and bitcoin are different? In light of the relentless shrill arguments in favor of using only cash to avoid government scrutiny that I keep getting from this web site it seems kind of contradictory. You hate bitcoin. I get it. There is a lot to hate there. My base case for many years is that the developed world would use financial repression to inflate away debt of as much as 400% of GDP. Russell Napier has a whole song and dance about this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyYXqeF7De8\n\n>  It puzzled me how everything hadn’t fallen down and gone boom long ago until a few days ago I came across this guy Michael Howell:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHFPRnMhX2A\n\n>  He explains patiently that absolute debt levels don’t matter anymore because paying down debt is passé. Nowadays we make minimum payments on loans. My experience of running up un-payable credit card debt in university showed me what will happen. The end game is hyperinflation not financial repression.\n\n>  Incidentally Russell Napier thinks that Bitcoin will be banned, precisely because it allows one to circumvent government efforts to do financial repression. He doesn’t think gold will be banned. I think that is amusingly short sighted. Governments operate for the benefit of the rich. A lot of gold is owned by poor people in India. They will not let poor people benefit from currency revaluation (fast or slow).\n   \n\nThis is Dr. Smith's reply:  \n\n\n\n*Sigh*\n\n>  Is this serious? Gold has real world uses such as in industry, dentistry (gold restorations are the best, the most like original tooth but hard to do so dentists don’t bother) and for jewelry. Bitcoin does not. And it consumes enormous amounts of energy.\n  \n\nI did write a perfunctory reply to this but in retrospect I was too hasty.  I was kind of put off by Dr. Smith's  attitude so I didn't feel like doing research.  This is an effort to put all this on a more solid footing:  \n\n*  First we have to understand the difference between a monetary metal and an industrial metal. A monetary metal is, be definition, one that has no use value. It derives it's value from \"salience\".  That means that people have collectively decided that gold is a thing of value.  There is nothing else that goes into it.  Years ago banks held silver as a monetary metal. In 1873 after more than 4000 years they decided that silver was no longer an item of value.  This happened principally because silver had become an industrial metal.  There was another reason but I will get back to it.  \n\n*  It would be disingenuous to say that gold has no industrial uses.  Clearly gold is very important to the electronics industry.  Statista breaks down world gold uses like so:  10% industrial, 50% jewelry, 40% investment.  My research tells me that about 80% of this jewelry demand is actually investment purchases by women in the far east.  That still leaves about 10% that is jewelry purchases that are not directly or indirectly for investment purposes.  I have a wedding ring made of gold.  I don't ever intend to sell it but I am aware that it has some resale value.  I think that all gold jewelry is implicitly an investment.   It strikes me that central banks are shaking in their boots.  They have a big investment in gold but they are well aware that the world runs on electronics that use large amount of gold.  I will be willing to bet that they are contemplating a move to bitcoin but they are concerned about their large investment in gold bullion.  \n\n* The issue of energy use is complex.  Firstly let's look at the text of the article which tells us that more than 90% of all bitcoins have already been mined.  That tells me that we have reached a point of diminishing returns in bitcoin mining.  I expect that in the future bitcoin mining will become a much lower energy use activity.  Gold mining on the other hand will continue and grow for hundreds of years.  The pollution caused by gold mining is epic.  Gold is frequently [extracted with cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_cyanidation). It poisons rivers and kills people.  The mining industry has pioneered the use of electric vehicles for underground use.  They have to worry about trapped explosive gasses, but the mining industry uses enormous amounts of fossil fuels.  There is no question that mining is a major pollution source.  There is this green chicken that makes speeches on the internet.  He seems to feel that the world is moving to an energy transition that involves using natural gas as a bridge to a fully electric and photovoltaic or nuclear or ...   something future.  He is mostly correct.  What I think he is wrong about is the speed that this transition is taking.  It will all be over in 15 years.  The natural gas powered truck will come and go so fast you won't even see it.   Finally, it is important to remember that the big AI companies are building nuclear power plants right now. Let's just keep this in perspective.   \n\nI have more thoughts.  Let me know what you think.  \n\n",

        "text": "Hot on the heels of the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) recent resumption of official gold purchases (after a six-month pause), and amid ongoing economic turmoil domestically and trade-war threats geopolitically, Beijing has launched a pilot program  that allows insurers to buy gold for the first time could free up billions of dollars of investment in the metal, adding further impetus to a record-setting rally, hitting a new high (in USD) above $2900 this morning...\n\n\n\nAs Bloomberg reports, ten insurance firms - including PICC Property & Casualty Co. and China Life Insurance Co., two of China’s biggest - will be able to invest as much as 1% of their assets in bullion, in a program that became effective last Friday. \n\nThat would translate into a potential 200 billion yuan ($27.4 billion) of funds, Minsheng Securities Co. said in a note.\n\nThe shift in policy in China could be a signal that authorities recognize the dearth of investment options in Asia’s largest economy, and the need for alternatives amid a property downturn and an economic slump.\n\n“Insurance companies lack options for mid- and long-term assets with stable yields,” Guotai Junan Securities analysts led by Liu Xinqi said in a note, even though bullion typically doesn’t offer that.\n\nThe policy tweak makes gold the first commodity that Chinese insurers have been explicitly permitted to invest in. \n\nChina has restricted insurance funds from taking positions in assets without “stable cash returns,” and limits the amount they can put into bonds and stocks.\n\nAs Jesse Colombo concluded earlier, all signs point to the potential for another explosive gold rally driven by Chinese demand, much like what unfolded last spring. With SHFE gold futures breaking out, the possibility of rising trading volumes, and the return of a Chinese gold price premium, the conditions for another bullish episode are falling into place. China’s economic crisis, record-low bond yields, and the looming prospect of massive stimulus only strengthen the case for gold’s continued ascent. Meanwhile, the PBOC’s renewed gold purchases, alongside this new insurance-gold-purchasing pilot program reinforce the broader shift toward gold as a preferred asset\n\nIf these factors align as expected, the next phase of this bull market could be even more dramatic than what we saw in 2024.From zero hedge.",

Just looking for some insight on a subject I couldn’t find many recent threads on.\n\nMy partner and I are in the process of starting a brick and mortar “cash for gold” business in the heart of downtown of a 2.5M population American city who’s main industry is tourism. We’ve applied for all the necessary licenses and permits, have sufficient liquid assets to bankroll our startup, have purchased a portable XRF machine (Thermo Fisher Niton XL2), own the property and office space outright where our business will be located, etc.\n\nWhat is the viability of this type of business in 2025? From what little I’ve read on this, I know that marketing is probably the biggest factor in terms of who is successful and who is not. We plan on heavily marketing the business online using pay-per-click ad campaigns. We’ve designed our location to be very competitive as far as attracting customers. For example: our central downtown location will be built into an existing Criminal Defense law firm. 95% of that firm’s clients pay cash up front to retain representation for their legal matters. The idea is to offer the gold buying service as a financing option to clients who might otherwise have to obtain money from their friends or family in order to hire an attorney.\n\nAs I said earlier, we will also be investing in other marketing options to reach potential new clients, especially (if not exclusively) online.\n\nAs far as security is concerned, we are taking a small private office located inside the law firm and converting it to be a secure space complete with bulletproof wall panels, a walk-up “bank teller” style window with adequate ballistic glass for handling all transactions, and a controlled entry ballistic grade door. Cameras are already installed at various positions throughout the entire law office building and additional cameras will be installed to cover the secure office space where the gold/cash transactions will occur. Inside the 12x10 foot secure room will be the XRF machine, a computer and printer, a large safe, scales, etc. Also of major note is the fact that two, armed security guards patrol the law building during business hours and, once we open for business, one of the guards’ duties will be tailored to patrol and oversee primarily the law office’s reception area and the controlled access hallway leading up to the bank-style teller window and C4G office door. Keep in mind that there are about 100 law office personnel working in offices within the same building as the cash for gold office.\n\nWhat am I missing? Any advice as to equipment, additional security measures, marketing?\n\nThere are two competing cash for gold locations within 1-2 blocks of us. One is a pawnshop.\n\nThanks in advance for your attention and advice!",

        "text": "Ongoing Gold & Silver Short Squeeze Continues\nFebruary 6 (King World News) – James Turk:  The new year has opened with a bang, Eric, and I expect the good news for gold and silver bulls to continue — provided you own physical metal, which means we need to discuss this ongoing squeeze of short positions in gold and silver that is receiving a lot of media attention. \n\nTariffs are being bandied about as the cause, but I think there is more to it because it is not logical or profitable to delay delivery on short positions.\n\nDecades ago when I first started trading futures, deliveries by the shorts were made on or near what is called First Notice Day. It is always advantageous for the shorts to deliver as soon as possible, but they have to wait for FND. These dates are announced by Comex years in advance.\n\nThe shorts want to deliver because they want to get rid of the metal they sold in advance through futures or forwards and get paid for the metal they are selling. Those dollars they receive from the sale/delivery could then be spent or invested to earn interest, so there is no reason to hold off on meeting their delivery obligation. \n\nAlso, once the metal is delivered, the buyer now pays the metal’s storage. That cost savings is another advantage for the shorts to deliver as soon as possible on or immediately after FND. And that’s the way it works in normal markets. \n\nSo the delays to deliver physical metal – which news reports are saying is several weeks – is not normal. But it is not tariffs that are causing these distortions in my view. \n\nIt’s happening because there are vastly more promises to deliver gold than there is physical metal available at current prices, and maybe even more promises than there is existent gold. The same is true for silver. \n\nConsider this comment in London’s Financial Times. The flow physical of physical metal out of London to New York:\n\n“is causing disruption to the gold market, and has increased the cost of borrowing gold.”\n\nLet’s unpack this sentence. If you are short gold and need to deliver, you must deliver. If you don’t, you default, which could put you or your business if you are a dealer into bankruptcy. That’s what happened to Volume Investors back in 1985, but its collapse was an isolated event with limited knock-on affect.\n\nVolume Investors failed to deliver cash on a margin call, but dollars can be easily borrowed if you are creditworthy (Volume Investors wasn’t). Banks create dollars when they make a loan, but banks cannot conjure up physical gold and silver. So metals have to be borrowed from existent stock, and the shorts are discovering that physical metal is being held by strong hands unwilling to lend their gold – even at these abnormally high interest rates – because they don’t want to take the risk of dealer defaults and never seeing their gold again.\n\nBut there is also another type of strong hands. It is the holders of physical metal unwilling to sell at current prices because they expect prices to rise much further. It’s the same thing that happened in the 1930s. People moved their purchasing power (money) out of banks into paper currency initially, and then as those promises became doubted, out of dollars into gold. The fractional reserve system of more gold promises than existent physical metal is contracting. \n\nSo the shorts have a serious problem, Eric, that is apparent in this gold chart. \n\nKing World News note: The lack of available physical gold has kept pullbacks in the gold market very shallow, despite the blistering upside move from $1,800 to $2,900\n\n\n\nGold had been stair-stepping higher throughout 2024 until a brief shakeout in November. That drop was probably engineered by the shorts because they knew what was coming. So they were no doubt hoping to pick up some physical metal before getting squeezed, which began in earnest during December deliveries.\n\nThat month the shorts – namely the dealers – discovered that it was a hard sell to convince buyers to roll their position into some London paper gold scheme, even when offered enticing rates. Since December the squeeze on shorts has tightened, and as the chart shows, gold is rocketing higher.Written by James Turk.",

Apparently the Chinese invest very heavy in real estate getting second homes and things like that to preserve and build wealth instead of getting in stock markets, this is fine when real estate goes up but when the population is declining & real estate prices are projected to fall massively cause of the population decline I’m wondering if more Chinese are throwing money into gold rather than real estate. \nIn my layman thinking, it makes sense that the Chinese would buy gold to preserve their wealth when they can’t trust their stock markets or real estate. \nGold like everything else is at the mercy of supply and demand, and if you have a culture like china that is more prone to saving, and you have hundreds of millions of people in that culture buying gold rather than real estate you might end up in a scenario like now where gold is having crazy gains, way above just regular inflation. \nI’m just wondering if this huge price, almost 3000 an oz is more like a bubble and is based more on huge demand coming from hundreds of millions rather than just simply gold following inflation. \nGold is up 41% in the past year.. that’s multiples above inflation.

Since this purchase is classified as grantor investment trusts, I am not sure if the tax treatment is different from the typical Roth IRA (which is no tax on gains)\n\nAnother thing confusing me is I read that if you hold a gold ETF (IAU) in a regular brokerage account (not IRA), you have to report the IAU maintenance fees as income, as Gold ETF fees are taxed as collectible income.\n\n#2.

I have seen many places calling for stocks to decline due to tarrifs, so gold could be the best alternative? I also saw tarrifs would cause lots of inflation, which is generally considered good for gold prices. Are there any blind spots in my analysis?\n\nAlso, since products from Canada exported into the United States incurs a tarrifs, could the gold and silver from Canada be devalued compared to the gold and silver in the US? It seems like it wouldnt make sense and maybe a little stupid question. Is gold not tarrifed?\nThanks",

        "text": "If you’ve spent any time in the world of gold and silver, you’ve probably noticed there are *distinct* personalities in this space. Whether you’re at a coin shop, a Reddit thread, or a gold convention, chances are you’ve run into all four of these types:\n\n# 🪙 Type 1: The Sound Money Purist (a.k.a. “Gold is Real Money” Guy)\n\nThese folks don’t just stack gold—they *preach* it. To them, **gold and silver are the only real money**. Everything else? Fake. Fiat currency? A scam. The Federal Reserve? A Ponzi scheme. Their dream? **Bringing back the gold standard and watching fiat burn.** They likely own a copy of *The Creature from Jekyll Island*, have strong opinions on central banking, and believe that every economic collapse is just one step closer to their “I told you so” moment.\n\n# 💰 Type 2: The Hardcore Stacker (“Premiums? I’d Rather Die”)\n\nFor this person, **gold is wealth preservation**, plain and simple. They’re here to **protect their purchasing power**, not start a revolution. They’re laser-focused on **weight, spot price, and premiums**—and if you overpaid by even a few bucks, trust me, they’ll let you know. To them, **gold is gold**—doesn’t matter if it’s a Maple Leaf, a Krugerrand, or a scratched-up bar with bite marks from the last guy who tested it. If it’s the cheapest per ounce, it’s **good enough**.\n\n# 🧐 Type 3: The Numismatist (“Yes, But Is It Rare?”)\n\nThey’re not just stacking metal—they’re **hunting treasure**. This person loves the thrill of **finding rare coins, limited mintages, and historical pieces**. They’ll gladly pay **10x spot price** if it means securing a **low-population MS-70 from a forgotten 19th-century mint**. They obsess over coin grading, mint errors, and market trends, and while you’re hoarding bullion, they’re out here flipping **high-premium rarities** for insane profits—or holding onto them as *future* grail pieces.\n\n# ✨ Type 4: The Gold Aestheticist (“It’s Just Beautiful, Okay?”)\n\nSome people stack gold for its monetary value—these people stack it because **it’s stunning**. They don’t care about premiums, numismatics, or economic theories. They just love **gold**—the weight, the shine, the sheer beauty of it. Maybe they collect jewelry, maybe they just like to admire their coins under perfect lighting. Either way, their stack isn’t just an investment, it’s a **work of art**.\n\n**So, which one are you?** Or are you a mix of a few? No matter where you fall, we’re all here for the love of gold—whether it’s for wealth, history, security, or just pure admiration. **Drop a comment and tell us your type!** 🏆💰✨",

So i ask them , where is the difference? I know that gold and silver has not dropped dramatically. \nThere response is below. Can anyone explain this in Layman’s terms for me? I am at a loss with these people. \n\n“ The amount that you would get back if you sold them is the market value or numismatic value and that number is typically higher.\n \nYou will need to reach out to your precious metals dealer to find out what that value is.\n \nPlease see below information from our legal team:\n\nEquity Trust provides an indication value, based on the metal type held in your account.\nThe value is received daily from third-party sources that are also used by the depository that stores your metals.\nThis value is referred to as the spot price and is also sometimes referred to as the melt value.\nSpot price/melt value only considers the type of metals held and the total weight.\nPlease keep in mind that the spot price/melt value may not represent the value received if you sell the precious metals in the account.\nMetal sales typically are completed at market value, in other words, what a precious metals dealer is willing to pay you.\nMarket value is typically higher than Spot price/melt value.”\n\n**1/30/24 Update *** Finally, got a hold of Monetary Gold. The lady that works the front desk(!) said she had invested in long term gold and there was a 33% TRANSACTION FEE. I asked is there an exception for when a person dies? She did not know.\n\nFor months no one would answer my question about why market value did not reflect the 81k she invested. And after it is paid out, the front desk lady can answer the question. \n\nWho sells long-term metals to a 79 year old woman? She is sent me the contract my mother signed, and no where does it say anything about a 33% fee. I am lost, anything I can do? Arbitration is mentioned in the contract, is that an option?",

        "text": "Hi all, I’ve spent quite a lot of time researching into buying gold and I think I’ve decided that buying a 1oz gold bar would be best. I am thinking of stacking these for now, aiming to buy at least 1 per year (hopefully more if income allows) and keeping them as a long term investment. I wanted some advice please on what you would do in this scenario. Apologies if any of my terminology is incorrect:\n1. Am I right to go for the 1oz Gold Bar? I have read that there are higher premiums on smaller amounts so 1oz is like a good minimum weight\n2. Does the type of gold bar matter? I heard good things about PAMP for eg but if I am keeping them for at least 5-10 years, will that brand still be popular? Or should I not care about brand unless I am trying to flip them (which is far too intimidating for me right now 😅)\n3. Anything against the cast type or should I pay more for the minted?\n4. Since I am in the UK, should that influence where/what type I should buy? I heard some negative things about royal mint and good things about Australian, but since I am in the U.K. is it best to stick to my own country?\n5. If you were to buy for less time (eg sell within 5 years) would you change any of the answers to the above questions?\n\nThanks so much in advance",

        "text": "So I see this alot and run into this even more. Maybe those with more knowledge can expand on this topic, for old times sake. \n\nThe price of gold jewelry vs investment-type gold. \n\n\"The chain is 14k and weighs 12 grams, and costs [so much money over spot]. That's a rip off.\" \n\nWithin reason, yes, there is definitely some pieces that would fall into this category. But you cannot base your ripoff meter on the spot price alone. You have to do your research on the costs of similar items to determine \"ripoff\" potential.\n\nFor example, let's say that this fictional chain, 12 grams, 14k, costs 500% over spot price per gram. I know, I know, your ripoff meter is going off right now lol and you walk away from the deal but the guy behind you buys it outright, no negotiations.\n\nWhat happened??? Oh, you didn't realize that the chain was not only a vintage, but it was also from Cartier...just an example of why I feel its not good to judge a piece of jewelry by its weight. \n\nOr here is a more common example, an engagement ring. If any of yall have ever been in that process, once the girl sees the ring she has envisioned all of her life, the price per gram, the premium, all that mess, goes out the door. \"Babe, that's a ripoff, it only weighs 5 grams of 14k gold,\" good luck with that, you just shattered your fiancé 's perfect ring dream. \n\nAnyways, just trying to make a point. If the chain is costing on average the same amount as other competitors, boys and girls, it's not a ripoff, it's supply and demand. And if you go into buying a piece of jewelry with bullion prices in mind, you may need to check that outside the door, or just drill a hole on a gold buffalo, tie a shoe string through it, and wear it. Now that there my friends, is investment-type jewelry.\n\nLets get into it. Also, let's be respectful as well, hoping for some meaningful conversation 🙏",

The Shiller P/E ratio is approaching a 20 year high, it has never been this high without some sort of crash. \n\n\nThe only market conditions that are different is that inflation is down.  \n\n\nYes that's right I said down.  With exception of 1929 and 2020 the top 5 market crashes have been preceded by inflation rates of 3.8 to 6.2%.  2024 was 2.9%.  Current estimates for this year are 2.4-2.9% so it's headed down.  But if it hits 3% I would pay close attention.  The 1929 crash happened after a year of negative inflation.  Passive investing has passed active investing for the first time ever.  Warren Buffet is 50% cash right now.\n\n\nBUT WE'Re NOT WaRREn bUFfet\n\n\nHe's not the only one making that move.  All the popular hedgefunds are a larger percentage cash right now.  Berkshire Hathaway is 33% cash equivalents up from 17% in 2023.  Buffet was only 20% cash in Novemeber the bought the dip, a huge move no one is giving him credit for.  He literally took half his net worth and put it in something that was going down.\n\n\nIf you want something a little riskier but better upside go gold.  It goes up during volatility regardless of the market going up or down.  During a market crash it can go up fast or at worst it still recovers faster than the market.  I would say that any sort of crash would likely jump gold value as people would look to that rather than risking inflation going up more.   Gold price is even more effected by worldwide volatility than USA volatility, a huge driver of it right now is Saudis and other rich familys looking to preserve and grow their generational wealth.

        "text": "The markets are overreacting to the DeepSeek news. \n\nNvidia and big tech stocks losing a trillion dollars in value is not realistic. \n\nI personally am buying more NVDA stock off the dip. \n\nSo what is going on?\n\nThe reason for the drop:  Investors think DeepSeek threatens to disrupt the US big tech dominance by enabling smaller companies and cost-sensitive enterprises with an open source and low cost, high performance model. \n\nHere is why I think fears are overblown.\n\n1. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have massive war chests to outspend competitors. Nvidia alone spent nearly $9 billion on R&D in 2024 and can quickly adapt to new threats by enhancing its offerings or lowering costs if necessary.\n\n2. Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about hardware—it’s deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.\n\n3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. \n\n4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.\n\nCritiques tend to fall into two camps…\n\n1. Nvidias margins are going to be eroded \n\nTo this I think we have to acknowledge that while lower margins and demand would impact the stock both of these are speculative. \n\nIncreased efficiency typically increases demand. And Nvidias customers are pretty entrenched, it’s def not certain they will bleed customers. \n\nOn top of that Nvidia’s profitability isn’t solely tied to selling GPUs. Its software stack (e.g., CUDA), enterprise services, and licensing deals contribute significantly. These high-margin revenue streams I would guess are going to remain solid even if hardware pricing pressures increase.\n\n2. Open source has a number of relative advantages\n\nI think open source is heavily favorited by startups and indie developers (Open source is strongly favored by Reddit specifically). But the enterprise buyer doesn’t typically lean this way.\n\nOpen-source solutions require significant internal expertise for implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Large enterprises often prefer Nvidia’s support and commercial-grade stack because they get a dedicated team for ongoing updates, security patches, and scalability.",

They say \"long term\" and mean a few decades, they're absolutely horrified I only think two years down the road.\n\nMaybe I've been watching too much of Gary's Economics but I'm pessimistic as fuck about my future.

Increasingly, in general, assets are becoming a higher proportion of real wealth - gold, REITS.. the inability of Britain or the US to build housing stock surely will drive asset prices higher.

I probably won't make a fortune, but it doesn't efel totally irrational. \n\nTLDR I am investing based on a depressive outlook. What I suppose I'm looking to understand is does anyone feel this way?

        "text": "I'm not very fluent in investing, only having really gotten serious within the last year or so. My question is, should I just reallocate my portfolio over to VOO? It seems like putting all my eggs into one basket isn't the smartest idea, but when that basket appears to be made out of pure gold, maybe it's a better option. I really just want to retire (I'm in my late 30's) ASAP and I've heard that VOO and chill might be a good way to do so.\n\nEdit: My Vanguard portfolio says I'm invested in Target Retire 2050 Trust II which is 55.20% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares, 34.90% Vanguard Institutional Total International Stock Market Index Trust II, 6.8% Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund Institutional Shares, and 3.1% Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for the advice and information! It's clear to me now that I did not understand the annualized vs. overall gains. As u/thetreece said, I do not know enough about investing yet to be messing with my portfolio so I will leave it alone. This is a great sub and everyone has been very kind, thank you again.",

        "text": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates and a prominent investor, has frequently emphasized the importance of holding gold as part of a diversified investment portfolio. His preference for gold is rooted in several key factors tied to his broader economic philosophy.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dalio views gold as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. He often highlights that governments tend to print money during economic crises, which diminishes the purchasing power of traditional currencies. Gold, being a finite resource with intrinsic value, retains its purchasing power and often appreciates during periods of inflation.\n\nAdditionally, Dalio believes that gold serves as a reliable store of value during geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Unlike stocks or bonds, gold is not tied to any single government or corporation, making it a safer asset during turbulent times. He has pointed out that during periods of financial instability, gold often performs well, providing a necessary counterbalance to riskier investments.\n\nAnother factor is Dalio’s emphasis on risk diversification. His investment philosophy, which includes his well-known “All Weather Portfolio,” is centered on maintaining a balance across various asset classes to protect against unpredictable market conditions. Gold plays a crucial role in this strategy because it often moves inversely to equities and other financial assets. Given Dalio’s emphasis on preparing for “what you don’t know,” gold is a logical choice for him. \n\nMy question is how did someone like Dalio invest in gold? Given his wealth, it has to be some gold backed financial instrument in my mind.",

        "text": "The markets are overreacting to the DeepSeek news. \n\nNvidia and big tech stocks losing a trillion dollars in value is not realistic. \n\nI personally am buying more NVDA stock off the dip. \n\nSo what is going on?\n\nThe reason for the drop:  Investors think DeepSeek threatens to disrupt the US big tech dominance by enabling smaller companies and cost-sensitive enterprises with an open source and low cost, high performance model. \n\nHere is why I think fears are overblown.\n\n1. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have massive war chests to outspend competitors. Nvidia alone spent nearly $9 billion on R&D in 2024 and can quickly adapt to new threats by enhancing its offerings or lowering costs if necessary.\n\n2. Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about hardware—it’s deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.\n\n3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. \n\n4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.\n\nCritiques tend to fall into two camps…\n\n1. Nvidias margins are going to be eroded \n\nTo this I think we have to acknowledge that while lower margins and demand would impact the stock both of these are speculative. \n\nIncreased efficiency typically increases demand. And Nvidias customers are pretty entrenched, it’s def not certain they will bleed customers. \n\nOn top of that Nvidia’s profitability isn’t solely tied to selling GPUs. Its software stack (e.g., CUDA), enterprise services, and licensing deals contribute significantly. These high-margin revenue streams I would guess are going to remain solid even if hardware pricing pressures increase.\n\n2. Open source has a number of relative advantages\n\nI think open source is heavily favorited by startups and indie developers (Open source is strongly favored by Reddit specifically). But the enterprise buyer doesn’t typically lean this way.\n\nOpen-source solutions require significant internal expertise for implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Large enterprises often prefer Nvidia’s support and commercial-grade stack because they get a dedicated team for ongoing updates, security patches, and scalability.",

Here is the data from the article.\n\n||\n||\n|**Years (1/1972-10/2024)**|**Gold**|**S&P 500**|**Excess**|\n|Average|8.14% +/- 21.26%|11.00 +/- 16.59%|\\-2.86%|\n|Up Markets (508 12-month rolling periods)|9.33%|18.56%|\\-9.23%|\n|Down Markets (126 12-month rolling periods)|13.07%|\\-12.81%|25.88%|\n|Return to Risk Ratio|0.38|0.66|\\-0.28|\n|Inflation Ratio|0.24|0.48|\\-0.24|\n|Sharpe Ratio|0.27|0.47|\\-0.20|\n|Sortino Ratio|0.47|0.66|\\-0.19|\n|Best 12 Months|179.86%|61.18%|118.68|\n|Worst 12 Months|\\-37.78%|\\-43.32%|5.54%|\n\nOn the face of it, it appears that the S&P 500 is the far better investment if one were to look at the risk metrics. The market outperforms gold in terms of generating a profit, beating inflation, beating the risk-free rate, and controlling downside deviation. But here is the rub, it is all about risk mitigation through asset allocation. Here are the results if one were to mix the S&P 500 with 6% invested in gold\n\n||\n||\n|**Years (1/1972-10/2024)**|**S&P 500 with 6% Gold**|**S&P 500**|**Excess**|\n|Average|11.01% +/- 15.58%|11.00 +/- 16.59%|\\-0.02%|\n|Up Markets (508 12-month rolling periods)|17.94%|18.56%|\\-0.62%|\n|Down Markets (126 12-month rolling periods)|\\-11.41%|\\-12.81%|1.40%|\n|Return to Risk Ratio|0.71|0.66|0.04|\n|Inflation Ratio|0.51|0.48|0.03|\n|Sharpe Ratio|0.49|0.47|0.02|\n|Sortino Ratio|0.69|0.66|0.03|\n|Best 12 Months|59.51%|61.18%|\\-1.67|\n|Worst 12 Months|\\-41.17%|\\-43.32%|2.15%|\n\nNotice by mixing in a little gold in the all equity portfolio, we now beat the overall market in every risk category.\n\nGold is appropriate as an investment as part of an overall strategy.\n\nSource: Morningstar",

        "text": "I have been with my partner for almost 3 years now. Most of our monthly expenses are shared: rent, groceries, eating out, dog, gas, etc. I have the Amex gold card for dining out & groceries, while she has the Chase sapphire reserve for travel & other expenses. We are both authorized users on each other's cards, & these cards are used for a majority of our expenses. We are wanting to have a joint account of sorts to make sure things stay fair (neither of us feel unfair but just seems to make sense since all of our expenses are for both of us anyway lol).\n\nHow does everyone do this? I think we were thinking to max out our Roth IRAs first, & then maybe contribute a certain % to 401k? We know we have to have an emergency fund in a HYSA, but this HYSA will just be in 1 person's name, with the 2nd person just having access, & we just pay the shared expenses off our credit cards from here? & then do we also just keep contributing to this shared HYSA with a % of our income? She threw out 90% & then 10% of our income we keep for ourselves - does this seem reasonable? I truly have no idea. Do we invest everything after we hit our emergency fund # into the market? How do you keep investing in individual brokerage accounts at the same time? Looking for advice on where to start, what to consider, & how others are doing combined finances with their partners.",

        "text": "JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (among others) estimate a 30-40% chance of a large S&P 500 decline this year up to 30% with the maximum probable upside of 6-8%.  The Shiller P/E ratio is approaching a 20 year high, it has never been this high without some sort of crash. \n\n\nThe only market conditions that are different is that inflation is down.  \n\n\nYes that's right I said down.  With exception of 1929 and 2020 the top 5 market crashes have been preceded by inflation rates of 3.8 to 6.2%.  2024 was 2.9%.  Current estimates for this year are 2.4-2.9% so it's headed down.  But if it hits 3% I would pay close attention.  The 1929 crash happened after a year of negative inflation.  Passive investing has passed active investing for the first time ever.  Warren Buffet is 50% cash right now.\n\n\nBUT WE'Re NOT WaRREn bUFfet\n\n\nHe's not the only one making that move.  All the popular hedgefunds are a larger percentage cash right now.  Berkshire Hathaway is 33% cash equivalents up from 17% in 2023.  Buffet was only 20% cash in Novemeber the bought the dip, a huge move no one is giving him credit for.  He literally took half his net worth and put it in something that was going down.\n\n\nIf you want something a little riskier but better upside go gold.  It goes up during volatility regardless of the market going up or down.  During a market crash it can go up fast or at worst it still recovers faster than the market.  I would say that any sort of crash would likely jump gold value as people would look to that rather than risking inflation going up more.   Gold price is even more effected by worldwide volatility than USA volatility, a huge driver of it right now is Saudis and other rich familys looking to preserve and grow their generational wealth.  Gold is the new/old ETF it's already diversified into every country and every sector of industry.  ",

        "text": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates and a prominent investor, has frequently emphasized the importance of holding gold as part of a diversified investment portfolio. His preference for gold is rooted in several key factors tied to his broader economic philosophy.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dalio views gold as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. He often highlights that governments tend to print money during economic crises, which diminishes the purchasing power of traditional currencies. Gold, being a finite resource with intrinsic value, retains its purchasing power and often appreciates during periods of inflation.\n\nAdditionally, Dalio believes that gold serves as a reliable store of value during geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Unlike stocks or bonds, gold is not tied to any single government or corporation, making it a safer asset during turbulent times. He has pointed out that during periods of financial instability, gold often performs well, providing a necessary counterbalance to riskier investments.\n\nAnother factor is Dalio’s emphasis on risk diversification. His investment philosophy, which includes his well-known “All Weather Portfolio,” is centered on maintaining a balance across various asset classes to protect against unpredictable market conditions. Gold plays a crucial role in this strategy because it often moves inversely to equities and other financial assets. Given Dalio’s emphasis on preparing for “what you don’t know,” gold is a logical choice for him. \n\nMy question is how did someone like Dalio invest in gold? Given his wealth, it has to be some gold backed financial instrument in my mind.",

My current monthly investment plan is €380, but I’m evaluating how much to increase it. Additionally, I have some savings that I’d like to allocate efficiently, potentially increasing my equity exposure.\n\nI’m also considering adding a small allocation to gold as a reserve, though I’m still assessing whether it’s the right time to do so.\n\n**Current Portfolio:**\n\n* **EUNL Core MSCI World Usd:** €1933 - 34.68%\n* **IS3N Core MSCI EM IMI Usd:** €1367 - 24.53%\n* **2B76 Automation & Robotics Usd:** €892 - 16%\n* **USCP Ossiam Shiller Barclays Cape® US Sector Value TR EUR:** €841 - 15%\n* **IB25 Ibonds DEC 2025 Eur:** €330 - 5.93%\n\n*(Smaller holdings purchased in early 2024 before refining my strategy: VWCE, SPYA, CEBI, XGIN, GZUR)*\n\n**Monthly Savings Plan (€380):**\n\n* **EUNL Core MSCI World Usd:** €140\n* **IS3N Core MSCI EM IMI Usd:** €110\n* **2B76 Automation & Robotics Usd:** €65\n* **USCP Ossiam Shiller Barclays Cape® US Sector Value TR EUR:** €65\n\nI’m reviewing how to optimize my allocation and savings plan going forward, considering both diversification and risk management. Would be interested to hear how others approach similar situations.",

By the way, gold is a perfectly good way to invest and mitigate one's risk. Here is the data from the article.\n\n||\n||\n|**Years (1/1972-10/2024)**|**Gold**|**S&P 500**|**Excess**|\n|Average|8.14% +/- 21.26%|11.00 +/- 16.59%|\\-2.86%|\n|Up Markets (508 12-month rolling periods)|9.33%|18.56%|\\-9.23%|\n|Down Markets (126 12-month rolling periods)|13.07%|\\-12.81%|25.88%|\n|Return to Risk Ratio|0.38|0.66|\\-0.28|\n|Inflation Ratio|0.24|0.48|\\-0.24|\n|Sharpe Ratio|0.27|0.47|\\-0.20|\n|Sortino Ratio|0.47|0.66|\\-0.19|\n|Best 12 Months|179.86%|61.18%|118.68|\n|Worst 12 Months|\\-37.78%|\\-43.32%|5.54%|\n\nOn the face of it, it appears that the S&P 500 is the far better investment if one were to look at the risk metrics. The market outperforms gold in terms of generating a profit, beating inflation, beating the risk-free rate, and controlling downside deviation. But here is the rub, it is all about risk mitigation through asset allocation. Here are the results if one were to mix the S&P 500 with 6% invested in gold\n\n||\n||\n|**Years (1/1972-10/2024)**|**S&P 500 with 6% Gold**|**S&P 500**|**Excess**|\n|Average|11.01% +/- 15.58%|11.00 +/- 16.59%|\\-0.02%|\n|Up Markets (508 12-month rolling periods)|17.94%|18.56%|\\-0.62%|\n|Down Markets (126 12-month rolling periods)|\\-11.41%|\\-12.81%|1.40%|\n|Return to Risk Ratio|0.71|0.66|0.04|\n|Inflation Ratio|0.51|0.48|0.03|\n|Sharpe Ratio|0.49|0.47|0.02|\n|Sortino Ratio|0.69|0.66|0.03|\n|Best 12 Months|59.51%|61.18%|\\-1.67|\n|Worst 12 Months|\\-41.17%|\\-43.32%|2.15%|\n\nNotice by mixing in a little gold in the all equity portfolio, we now beat the overall market in every risk category.\n\nGold is appropriate as an investment as part of an overall strategy.\n\nSource: Morningstar",

Most of our monthly expenses are shared: rent, groceries, eating out, dog, gas, etc. I have the Amex gold card for dining out & groceries, while she has the Chase sapphire reserve for travel & other expenses. We are both authorized users on each other's cards, & these cards are used for a majority of our expenses. We are wanting to have a joint account of sorts to make sure things stay fair (neither of us feel unfair but just seems to make sense since all of our expenses are for both of us anyway lol).\n\nHow does everyone do this? I think we were thinking to max out our Roth IRAs first, & then maybe contribute a certain % to 401k? We know we have to have an emergency fund in a HYSA, but this HYSA will just be in 1 person's name, with the 2nd person just having access, & we just pay the shared expenses off our credit cards from here? & then do we also just keep contributing to this shared HYSA with a % of our income? She threw out 90% & then 10% of our income we keep for ourselves - does this seem reasonable? I truly have no idea. Do we invest everything after we hit our emergency fund # into the market? How do you keep investing in individual brokerage accounts at the same time? Looking for advice on where to start, what to consider, & how others are doing combined finances with their partners.",

While I can't open an IRA, I am able to invest the money and collect capital gains without it impacting my eligibility. \n\nMy parents are Boomers, and keep telling me I need to invest for the \"long term\".. To me, logically I know that is true but the fuck does it matter if corporations don't have any incentive to care beyond the next quarter? They say \"long term\" and mean a few decades, they're absolutely horrified I only think two years down the road.\n\nMaybe I've been watching too much of Gary's Economics but I'm pessimistic as fuck about my future. I'd rather throw my money into a water scarcity ETF - it is a certainty within 20 years we'll face global water shortages. Defense contractors like Lockheed or Rhienmetall are always a good bet given the justified European rearmament and America's inability to understand the word \"peace\". Increasingly, in general, assets are becoming a higher proportion of real wealth - gold, REITS.. the inability of Britain or the US to build housing stock surely will drive asset prices higher. It serves no rational actor any good to solve the problem.\n\nI figure I ought to turn these sour thoughts of mine into potentially fruitful investments. I probably won't make a fortune, but it doesn't efel totally irrational. \n\nTLDR I am investing based on a depressive outlook. What I suppose I'm looking to understand is does anyone feel this way?

Kodak is undergoing a **structural transformation**, pivoting from a declining legacy print business into higher-margin verticals such as **pharmaceutical manufacturing and advanced materials**. Despite strong **underlying asset value**, significant **hidden real estate assets**, and a **near-term deleveraging catalyst**, the stock trades at **only 0.4x book value**, well below its intrinsic worth.\n\nWe believe **Wall Street misprices Kodak** by failing to incorporate:  \n✅ The **imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025**, with attractive margin dynamics.  \n✅ **Debt reduction from pension surplus**, improving FCF and balance sheet health.  \n✅ **Strong tariff tailwinds under the Trump administration**, positioning Kodak as a beneficiary of U.S. domestic manufacturing policies.  \n✅ **Underappreciated real estate assets (Eastman Business Park)**, with a potential fair value of **$175M-$200M**.\n\n# Valuation Snapshot\n\n|**Metric**|**Base Case ($/Share)**|**Bear Case ($/Share)**|**Bull Case ($/Share)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**DCF Valuation**|**$18.42**|**$11.63**|**$24.00**|\n|**Liquidation Value**|**$17.78**|**$12.50**|**$22.50**|\n|**EV/EBITDA Valuation**|**$12.30**|**$9.75**|**$15.00**|\n|**P/E Valuation (12x Earnings)**|**$11.35**|**$8.50**|**$13.50**|\n|**Current Market Price**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|\n\n📌 **Our target price of $18.50 is based on a blended DCF and sum-of-the-parts valuation.**\n\n# 1. Company Overview & Strategic Pivot\n\nKodak operates across **four primary segments**:\n\n1. **Print & Imaging (55% of 2024 revenue)**\n   * Declining legacy business, but Kodak is stabilizing margins at **20% gross margin**.\n2. **Advanced Materials & Chemicals (22%)**\n   * High-margin segment (**27% EBITDA margin**) that supplies key specialty chemicals.\n3. **Brand Licensing & Real Estate (10%)**\n   * Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP), a 1,200-acre industrial park** undervalued on the balance sheet.\n4. **Pharmaceuticals (13% by 2025)**\n   * New revenue driver, projected to **generate $149M in 2025 with 35% margins**.\n\nKodak’s **pharmaceutical expansion** is the primary catalyst for **margin improvement and revenue diversification**. With **government incentives supporting domestic drug manufacturing**, Kodak is well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\n# 2.

Kodak is undergoing a **structural transformation**, pivoting from a declining legacy print business into higher-margin verticals such as **pharmaceutical manufacturing and advanced materials**. Despite strong **underlying asset value**, significant **hidden real estate assets**, and a **near-term deleveraging catalyst**, the stock trades at **only 0.4x book value**, well below its intrinsic worth.\n\nWe believe **Wall Street misprices Kodak** by failing to incorporate:  \n✅ The **imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025**, with attractive margin dynamics.  \n✅ **Debt reduction from pension surplus**, improving FCF and balance sheet health.  \n✅ **Strong tariff tailwinds under the Trump administration**, positioning Kodak as a beneficiary of U.S. domestic manufacturing policies.  \n✅ **Underappreciated real estate assets (Eastman Business Park)**, with a potential fair value of **$175M-$200M**.\n\n# Valuation Snapshot\n\n|**Metric**|**Base Case ($/Share)**|**Bear Case ($/Share)**|**Bull Case ($/Share)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**DCF Valuation**|**$18.42**|**$11.63**|**$24.00**|\n|**Liquidation Value**|**$17.78**|**$12.50**|**$22.50**|\n|**EV/EBITDA Valuation**|**$12.30**|**$9.75**|**$15.00**|\n|**P/E Valuation (12x Earnings)**|**$11.35**|**$8.50**|**$13.50**|\n|**Current Market Price**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|\n\n📌 **Our target price of $18.50 is based on a blended DCF and sum-of-the-parts valuation.**\n\n# 1. Company Overview & Strategic Pivot\n\nKodak operates across **four primary segments**:\n\n1. **Print & Imaging (55% of 2024 revenue)**\n   * Declining legacy business, but Kodak is stabilizing margins at **20% gross margin**.\n2. **Advanced Materials & Chemicals (22%)**\n   * High-margin segment (**27% EBITDA margin**) that supplies key specialty chemicals.\n3. **Brand Licensing & Real Estate (10%)**\n   * Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP), a 1,200-acre industrial park** undervalued on the balance sheet.\n4. **Pharmaceuticals (13% by 2025)**\n   * New revenue driver, projected to **generate $149M in 2025 with 35% margins**.\n\nKodak’s **pharmaceutical expansion** is the primary catalyst for **margin improvement and revenue diversification**.

So it is not intended as financial advice of any kind.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fn7o03doztfe1.png?width=270&format=png&auto=webp&s=939da4c7213e1a30ff5e790cd2c52bdead1648ec\n\nSince english is not my first language, I used some AI magic to wrap up all my DD in two different formats (equity research and ELI5). And I know, the price at close today was higher.\n\n# Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE: KODK) – Equity Research Report\n\n# Rating: Overweight | Target Price: $18.50 | Current Price: $6.79\n\n# Sector: Specialty Chemicals & Industrial Manufacturing\n\n# Investment Summary\n\nWe initiate coverage on Eastman Kodak (NYSE: KODK) with an **Overweight** rating and a **target price of $18.50**, representing a **172% upside**. Kodak is undergoing a **structural transformation**, pivoting from a declining legacy print business into higher-margin verticals such as **pharmaceutical manufacturing and advanced materials**. Despite strong **underlying asset value**, significant **hidden real estate assets**, and a **near-term deleveraging catalyst**, the stock trades at **only 0.4x book value**, well below its intrinsic worth.\n\nWe believe **Wall Street misprices Kodak** by failing to incorporate:  \n✅ The **imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025**, with attractive margin dynamics.  \n✅ **Debt reduction from pension surplus**, improving FCF and balance sheet health.  \n✅ **Strong tariff tailwinds under the Trump administration**, positioning Kodak as a beneficiary of U.S. domestic manufacturing policies.  \n✅ **Underappreciated real estate assets (Eastman Business Park)**, with a potential fair value of **$175M-$200M**.\n\n# Valuation Snapshot\n\n|**Metric**|**Base Case ($/Share)**|**Bear Case ($/Share)**|**Bull Case ($/Share)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**DCF Valuation**|**$18.42**|**$11.63**|**$24.00**|\n|**Liquidation Value**|**$17.78**|**$12.50**|**$22.50**|\n|**EV/EBITDA Valuation**|**$12.30**|**$9.75**|**$15.00**|\n|**P/E Valuation (12x Earnings)**|**$11.35**|**$8.50**|**$13.50**|\n|**Current Market Price**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|**$6.79**|\n\n📌 **Our target price of $18.50 is based on a blended DCF and sum-of-the-parts valuation.**\n\n# 1. Company Overview & Strategic Pivot\n\nKodak operates across **four primary segments**:\n\n1. **Print & Imaging (55% of 2024 revenue)**\n   * Declining legacy business, but Kodak is stabilizing margins at **20% gross margin**.\n2. **Advanced Materials & Chemicals (22%)**\n   * High-margin segment (**27% EBITDA margin**) that supplies key specialty chemicals.\n3. **Brand Licensing & Real Estate (10%)**\n   * Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP), a 1,200-acre industrial park** undervalued on the balance sheet.\n4. **Pharmaceuticals (13% by 2025)**\n   * New revenue driver, projected to **generate $149M in 2025 with 35% margins**.\n\nKodak’s **pharmaceutical expansion** is the primary catalyst for **margin improvement and revenue diversification**. With **government incentives supporting domestic drug manufacturing**, Kodak is well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\n# 2. Financial Model & Valuation\n\n# 2.1 Revenue Breakdown & Forecast (2025-2029)\n\n|**Division**|**2024 Revenue ($M)**|**2025 Revenue ($M)**|**2029 Revenue ($M) (Bull Case)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Print & Imaging**|**$570M**|**$550M** (Decline)|**$510M**|\n|**Advanced Materials & Chemicals**|**$228M**|**$239M** (Growth)|**$290M**|\n|**Brand Licensing & Real Estate**|**$104M**|**$108M**|**$120M**|\n|**Pharma Division (New)**|**$135M**|**$149M** (Growth)|**$250M**|\n|**Total Revenue**|**$1,037M**|**$1,141M**|**$1,170M**|\n\n# 2.2 EBITDA & Free Cash Flow (FCF) Model\n\n|**Metric**|**2024 (Estimate)**|**2025 (Projected)**|**2026-2029 (Avg.)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**EBITDA ($M)**|**$180M**|**$210M**|**$225M**|\n|**FCF ($M)**|**$80M**|**$120M**|**$150M**|\n|**Net Debt ($M)**|**$460M**|**$145M**|**$50M**|\n|**Net Debt / EBITDA**|**2.6x**|**0.7x**|**0.2x**|\n\n📌 **Kodak is set to generate $120M in FCF in 2025**, a **50% improvement from 2024** due to lower CAPEX and debt reduction.\n\n# 3. Key Catalysts & Upside Drivers\n\n# 3.1 Pension Surplus & Debt Reduction\n\n* Kodak **will use $315M in pension assets to reduce debt**, lowering interest costs by **$25M annually**.\n* **Net debt will decline to $145M, reducing leverage to 0.7x EBITDA.**\n* This **significantly increases Free Cash Flow (FCF) starting in 2025**.\n\n# 3.2 Pharma Division Launch in 2025\n\n* Kodak’s **API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) manufacturing facility** is near completion.\n* The pharma sector offers **30%-40% gross margins**, significantly higher than print.\n* **Government incentives for domestic API production could drive contract wins.**\n* **Projected revenue: $149M in 2025 → $250M by 2029.**\n\n# 3.3 Trade Tariff Tailwinds\n\n* **Trump’s trade policies favor U.S. manufacturers** in specialty chemicals and pharma.\n* Tariffs on **Chinese imports** could make Kodak’s products **more competitive**.\n* **Kodak is well-positioned as a U.S.-based supplier**.\n\n# 3.4 Real Estate Monetization - Hidden Value in EBP\n\n* **Eastman Business Park (EBP)** is worth **$175M-$200M**, but it’s booked at **$60M**.\n* Leasing out or **selling portions of EBP could unlock value**.\n\n# 4. Investment Risks & Mitigation\n\n|**Risk Factor**|**Impact**|**Mitigation Strategy**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Declining Print Business**|Print revenue declining 5% YoY.|**high-margin Pharma & Chemicals**Focus on  .|\n|**Execution Risk in Pharma**|Regulatory or contract issues.|**Target pre-signed API supply contracts**.|\n|**Supply Chain & Tariff Risks**|Cost increases from import tariffs.|**Domestic manufacturing advantage** offsets risk.|\n\n# 5. Conclusion: A Deep Value Play\n\nKodak presents a **compelling risk-reward opportunity** driven by:\n\n1. **Pharma division launch in 2025** (high-margin growth engine).\n2. **Debt reduction through pension surplus**, boosting FCF.\n3. **Hidden real estate value in Eastman Business Park**.\n4. **Trade tailwinds under Trump favoring domestic manufacturing**.\n\n📌 **Rating: Overweight**  \n📌 **Target Price: $18.50** (172% upside)\n\nKodak is a **highly asymmetric deep-value opportunity** with significant potential for re-rating in 2025. 🚀\n\n\n\n# ELI5: Why Kodak is a Good Investment Right Now 📈\n\nImagine you have **an old company like Kodak**, which used to make cameras and films. People think it’s outdated, but here’s the **secret**—Kodak is quietly transforming into something much bigger. And **Wall Street isn’t paying attention yet**.\n\nHere’s why **smart investors** might want to take a closer look at Kodak:\n\n# 1️⃣ Kodak Is Getting Into Pharmaceuticals (Drugs 💊)\n\n* Kodak is **building a factory** to make ingredients for medicines.\n* This **new business starts in 2025** and will make **a lot more money per dollar spent** than selling old-school film and prints.\n* Think of it like Kodak **switching from selling DVDs to streaming movies—it’s the future!**\n* **This new drug business could bring in over $250M a year** in just a few years.\n\n# 2️⃣ Kodak Is Paying Off a TON of Debt 💰\n\n* Kodak had **a special pension fund with $1.08 BILLION** saved up.\n* They will use **$315M to pay down debt**, meaning they **don’t have to pay as much interest anymore**.\n* **This frees up an extra $25M per year!**\n* Less debt = **stronger company + more money to grow the business**.\n\n# 3️⃣ Hidden Gold Mine: Kodak Owns a HUGE Industrial Park 🏭\n\n* Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP)**, a **1,200-acre** industrial site.\n* Right now, it’s on the books for **only $60M**, but it’s actually worth **$175M+**.\n* If they **sell or rent out more space**, Kodak could **make a lot of extra money**.\n\n# 4️⃣ The Government Might Help Kodak (Trump's Trade Policies 🇺🇸)\n\n* The U.S. **wants to make more stuff at home** (like medicine and tech parts).\n* Kodak **makes things in America**, which means **they could get government support** and win new contracts.\n* If new tariffs (taxes on foreign goods) happen, Kodak’s **U.S.-made products become more valuable**.\n\n# 5️⃣ Kodak’s Stock Is TOO CHEAP 📉\n\n📌 **Right now, Kodak is trading at $6.79 per share.**  \n📌 **Experts say it should be worth between $11.50 - $24.00 per share!**  \n📌 That means the stock **could DOUBLE or even TRIPLE** in price.\n\n# 💡 What’s Next?\n\nKodak is **no longer just an “old camera company.”** With **pharma, real estate, and smart debt moves**, it **could become a big winner** in the next couple of years.\n\n✅ **New drug business = more profits**  \n✅ **Less debt = more cash to grow**  \n✅ **Hidden assets = even more value**  \n✅ **Government policies = possible tailwinds**\n\n**Right now, Wall Street isn’t paying attention… but soon, they might.** 🚀 \n\n\n\nSources:  \n[https://investor.kodak.com/financial-information/sec-filings](https://investor.kodak.com/financial-information/sec-filings)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-pharmaceutical-ingredient-factory-nearing-completion/amp/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-pharmaceutical-ingredient-factory-nearing-completion/amp/)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-prepares-to-terminate-u-s-pension-book-gain-of-more-than-500-million-d0cfb621](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kodak-prepares-to-terminate-u-s-pension-book-gain-of-more-than-500-million-d0cfb621)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-looks-to-terminate-us-pensions-will-gain-over-500-million-in-finances/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-looks-to-terminate-us-pensions-will-gain-over-500-million-in-finances/)  \n  \n[https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-increases-film-production-capacity-to-meet-commercial-consumer-demand/](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/business/local-business/kodak-increases-film-production-capacity-to-meet-commercial-consumer-demand/)  \n  \n[https://www.alcircle.com/news/kodak-s-call-for-tariffs-answered-us-to-impose-hefty-duties-on-imported-aluminium-printing-plates-112353?srsltid=AfmBOoqcAD-pC6yafn8auf4oN60aQaPUrgDLx2vh3zrUHHJyXT-TQNqx](https://www.alcircle.com/news/kodak-s-call-for-tariffs-answered-us-to-impose-hefty-duties-on-imported-aluminium-printing-plates-112353?srsltid=AfmBOoqcAD-pC6yafn8auf4oN60aQaPUrgDLx2vh3zrUHHJyXT-TQNqx)  \n\n\nBonus, real life DD:  \n  \nI did not know, but check how active are the Kodak clients/fans on other subredits there are literally dozens of posts each day including the word \"Kodak\".   \nAlso, the 90s are trendy these days, it is not unusual to see Gen Z youngsters with analogic cameras.",
