        "text": "Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the topic of gold revaluation is also ripping through the precious metal pundit circles at a galvanic pace, and for good reason.\n\nBased upon “reported” U.S. gold holdings, if gold were politically re-priced to just $4000 per ounce, that would create an additional $1.2T of instant liquidity (i.e. inflationary M2), which the Treasury Department could then direct deposit into an ever-drying TGA.\n\n(This direct deposit is made legal under Section 2.10 of the Financial Accounting Manual for Federal Reserve Banks.)\n\nSuch a gold revaluation policy would take a lot of pressure off Bessent’s Treasury Department and buy the U.S. more time and money for the aforementioned Trump policies to “Make America Great Again.”\n\nBut could a potential series of gold revaluations to inject new money into the TGA piggy bank truly make America, well… great?\n\nOr would it just save the U.S. economy from crumbling to the ground?\n\nKissinger’s Ghost\nIn the 1970s, Kissinger was very concerned when Europe, which collectively owned more gold than the U.S., wanted to revalue their gold to similarly cover their own debt disasters at home.\n\nThis would mean the U.S. would have to do the same, thereby playing its last Trump card (pun intended) of desperation (reverting to its gold vaults) in 1974.\n\nAnd why was Kissinger so terrified of having to resort to the ultimate “red button” act of desperation in the form of revaluing its last real form of sound money/wealth?\n\nBecause Kissinger knew then what many of us know.\n\nThat is, if the USA shows its hand and starts revaluing gold to higher and higher levels to pay down higher and higher levels of debt (to keep politicians in power and the masses free of pitchforks), this would mean the end of American supremacy, hegemony and/or the Pax Americana.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause he who has the most gold wins, and despite what the World Gold Council reports, it’s an open secret that America does not have the most gold (in a world of central banks stacking gold at record levels and COMEX revolving doors).\n\n\n\nThe Dilemma: Greatness or Survival?\nTrump, Bessent, and the USA itself thus face a debt trap and, hence, a sovereign dilemma of historical import.\n\nYes, certainly, the U.S. can and may revalue its gold holdings to dig itself partially out of debt and hence spur more growth.\n\nBut once/if the U.S. revalues, the rest of the world will naturally follow, and that will make the US just one more economically average nation among many, but certainly not the strongest anymore.\n\nKissinger knew this.\n\nDo Bessent and Trump?\n\nEither Way, Gold Wins\nRegardless of whether such a formal gold revaluation occurs from the top down in DC, the gold price will continue to rise (re-value itself) naturally from the bottom up for the simple reason that debt-soaked nations = debased currencies.\n\nGold, which only rises because fiat money inevitably suffocates under debt, sits at a different kind of historical moment.\n\nIt gets the last laugh because sovereign debt, led by sovereign mismanagement, has killed its sovereign currency in a death by a thousand cuts.\n\nSo, yes, gold gets the last laugh – but the circumstances couldn’t be sadder.by Zerohedge.",

        "text": "This year has started off with a golden hue. Gold and silver have been among the best-performing asset classes in 2025, up 12 percent and 14 percent, respectively, year-to-date. Over the past two months, these precious metals have outperformed bitcoin, which was the best performing asset in 2024, and equity markets around the world. Gold looks positioned to easily top $3,000 in coming weeks, with silver similarly hitting all-time highs.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons to believe that gold prices have further to run from here. Some of the biggest factors supporting a higher gold price include the ongoing accumulation of gold by central banks, persistent inflation, and a global supply shortage of physical gold.\n\nCentral banks, which hold as much as 20 percent of total global gold reserves, are key to the long-term growth in demand for the metal. In recent years, central banks around the world have been accumulating substantial quantities of gold. Net central bank acquisitions of gold topped 1,045 metric tons in 2024, marking the third year in a row of purchases above 1,000 metric tons. These figures reflect the publicly disclosed amounts; many observers believe that China and other countries are secretly acquiring gold well in excess of reported volumes. Most of the buying has come from outside of the United States and Western Europe. The four largest sovereign holders, the United States, Germany, France, and Italy, have been the exception to the gold rush led by the BRICS and other developing nations, and have not acquired additional reserve.By The Epoch Times.",

        "text": "There is a shortage of physical gold. The London Bullion Market Association is the center of gold trading around the world. Many nations have historically held their gold reserves with the Bank of England, but in recent years have been repatriating their holdings. This has disrupted the London markets and put pressure on prices.\n\nIn recent weeks, demand for delivery of physical gold has skyrocketed. Geopolitical concerns have led to a massive movement of physical gold out of the UK and Europe into vaults in New York and elsewhere. This has led to shortages and speculation of price manipulation. European markets have been spooked by President Trump’s saber-rattling over tariffs, and price differentials have opened up between gold markets across the Atlantic, accelerating the movement of bullion into the United States.\n\nThis spike in demand for physical gold, and resulting logistical bottlenecks, are not only pressuring gold prices but potentially creating a demand spiral. Analogous to a deposit run on a bank, gold customers concerned about the security of their holdings may accelerate demands to withdraw them. This could further squeeze physical supply and quickly boost prices. Many gold derivative contracts are linked to underlying physical collateral. If this collateral can’t be secured, the contracts can fail. This is one reason why holding physical gold is vastly superior to exchange-traded funds or other investment contracts that can’t guarantee delivery of the collateral on demand.\n\nSome gold industry observers have argued that there is evidence that the handful of large banks that issue most of the gold derivatives contracts have acted in concert to manipulate the price of gold. An illegal pricing cartel among the banks would not be unprecedented. The public discovered similar practices in the mortgage securities fraud leading up to the global financial crisis and in the manipulation of LIBOR (the interest rate at which banks lend to one another) uncovered a few years later.\n\nThe recent sharp rise in gold prices may put pressure on these banks and lead to instability in any price fixing arrangement. If the cartel unwinds, it could come quickly and violently. There would be winners and losers, and potential contagion into other markets. In other words, gold derivatives may become the epicenter of the next financial crisis. In such an event, demand for physical gold would spike further, as would prices.\n\nViews expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times or ZeroHedge.\n\n",

        "title": "The Fall of the German Mark and What It Means for the U.S. Dollar Today",
        "text": "This is a follow-up to my earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/1iv0pes/fort_knox_gold_audit_whats_the_real_play_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), where I was talking about the intent of opening up Fort Knox - was it really what was showcased as an audit of gold or just a smoke screen? A fellow redditor had made a point, which was a strong case for me to further research situations where a currency collapses – what happens to lenders (in current case, holders of TBills), everyday citizens and what not. So, I went to look for the case with Germany.\n\n  \n**Germany’s Currency Before WWI: A Strong and Stable Mark**\n\nBefore World War I, the German mark was one of the strongest currencies in the world. Germany was a rising industrial and economic power, competing directly with Britain and the United States. The Reichsmark was backed by gold, and its value remained stable due to prudent fiscal policies and Germany’s growing export economy.\n\nAt the time, 1 gold-backed German mark was roughly equivalent to $0.25 USD, which was a significant amount of purchasing power. Germany had a strong banking system, and its trade surplus helped maintain confidence in the currency. But World War I changed everything.\n\n**The Currency Collapse Between WWI and WWII**\n\nWhen Germany entered WWI (1914-1918), the government suspended the gold standard to finance the war. Instead of taxing its citizens, Germany printed massive amounts of paper money, assuming that it would win the war and repay its debts using reparations from defeated nations. What happened next? Germany lost the war and was forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which imposed 132 billion gold marks in reparations. The German government kept printing money to pay for war debts and reparations instead of finding sustainable revenue sources. By 1923, hyperinflation had completely destroyed the mark—at its peak, prices doubled every few hours.\n\nTo put it in perspective, in 1914, 1 USD was equal to 4 German marks but in 1923, 1 USD was at 4.2 trillion marks\n\nThis meant that workers were paid multiple times a day because their wages lost value within hours. People burned money for heat because it was cheaper than firewood. This economic catastrophe destroyed the German middle class and created deep resentment, laying the groundwork for the rise of Adolf Hitler.\n\n **Stabilization: The Dawes Plan, Young Plan & the Rise of Hitler**\n\nAfter hyperinflation, Germany introduced a new currency—the Rentenmark (1924)—which was backed by land and industrial goods instead of gold. The Dawes Plan (1924), funded mostly by U.S. banks, helped stabilize the economy by reducing reparation payments and injecting loans into German industry. Germany received an initial loan of 800 million marks, mostly from U.S. banks (e.g., J.P. Morgan & Co.). These loans helped stabilize Germany’s economy, rebuild infrastructure, and support industry. The German central bank (Reichsbank) was placed under international supervision to ensure financial discipline.\n\nBy 1929, the Young Plan further restructured German debt, but then came the Great Depression. The U.S. stock market crashed, cutting off financial support to Germany. Unemployment skyrocketed, and desperation led people to embrace radical political change—this was when Hitler gained momentum. Unlike the Dawes Plan, the Young Plan removed international control over the Reichsbank and German economy. By 1931, Germany was unable to continue payments, and international banks suffered losses. In 1932, the Lausanne Conference officially canceled most of Germany’s remaining reparations.\n\nBy 1933, Hitler completely abandoned all reparation payments, introduced the Reichsmark, and pushed Germany into military expansion, setting the stage for World War II.\n\n**The Role of Gold in Germany’s Economic Collapse**\n\nGold played an interesting role in this entire saga. Before WWI, the mark was backed by gold, ensuring stability. During WWI, Germany abandoned the gold standard, leading to reckless money printing. After hyperinflation, the new currency had to be backed by tangible assets (land & industry) instead of gold because the reserves were too depleted. When Hitler came to power, Germany began hoarding gold again, acquiring it through trade manipulation, looting, and war conquests. In short, the presence (or absence) of gold determined the fate of the German economy at every major turning point.\n\n**Parallels to the U.S. Dollar Today**\n\nFast forward to today, and we’re seeing some eerie similarities between the German mark’s downfall and the current state of the U.S. dollar.\n\nMassive Debt & Deficits - The U.S. national debt is now over $34 trillion, with annual deficits exceeding $2 trillion. The U.S. government relies on printing money and borrowing, similar to Germany post-WWI.\n\nRising Interest Payments - The U.S. now spends more on interest payments than on defense or Medicare. As interest rates rise, debt compounds faster, making repayment nearly impossible.\n\nForeign Holders of U.S. Debt - China, Japan, and other nations hold trillions in U.S. Treasury bonds. If they lose confidence in the dollar and start selling off debt, the U.S. could face a crisis similar to Germany’s post-WWI foreign debt crisis.\n\nDe-Dollarization - Many countries, including China, Russia, and BRICS nations, are moving away from the U.S. dollar for trade. If global confidence in the dollar collapses, hyperinflation is a real possibility, just like Germany in 1923.\n\nThe Role of Gold - Unlike in 1971 (when Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard), central banks today are hoarding gold at record levels. Countries like China, India and Russia are aggressively buying gold, preparing for a post-dollar world. If the dollar collapses, gold will once again be the ultimate store of value, just like it was during the German crises.\n\n**So, What Happens If the U.S. Dollar Collapses?**\n\nIf history repeats itself, the U.S. could face a stage of hyperinflation, making basic goods unaffordable for the average person. There would be massive economic and political upheaval, leading to radical changes in government policies and we could expect a shift to alternative stores of value, like gold, silver, Bitcoin, or a new international reserve currency. Finally, a potential loss of U.S. global dominance would mean other nations push for a multi-currency world order.\n\n**So what next?**\n\nHistory doesn’t repeat itself exactly, but the patterns are clear. Germany's currency collapse was a warning about the dangers of reckless money printing, excessive debt, and foreign reliance. The U.S. is not immune to these same forces.\n\nThese are my questions for a discussion to fellow redditors: \n\n1. **What do you think would happen to countries that hold US dollars (either as reserve currency or as T-Bills)? Will US default like Germany and finally have its debt cancelled by magic?**\n2. **What happens to our incomes? Does it mean our wages now go up in numbers (though not in value)?**\n3. **Finally, when Gold becomes a standard again, do you anticipate Executive Order 6102 in US to Banking Act of 1959 in Australia to Gold Ban act in 1966 in UK to Gold Control Act in India in 1968 and so on, to restrict private ownership of gold?**",

        "title": "Fort Knox Gold Audit: What’s the Real Play Here?",
        "text": "As someone who has always loved the shine of both Silver and Gold, I’ve seen countless debates about the U.S. gold reserves—especially regarding Fort Knox. Now, with reports that Trump and Elon Musk may push for an official audit, the implications of such a move need to be carefully considered.\n\nWhile transparency is valuable, an audit of this magnitude is a *high-stakes* play that could have profound consequences. If the gold is *not* there, the fallout could be catastrophic. But here’s the key point: **Trump and Elon would only push for this if they were certain the gold is accounted for.**\n\n# If the Gold Is Missing—What Happens?\n\n# 1. The Dollar Takes a Major Hit\n\nWhile the U.S. dollar is no longer backed by gold, its strength is underpinned by confidence in U.S. financial stability. If an audit were to reveal that Fort Knox is missing significant reserves:\n\n* **The dollar could devalue quickly** as global markets reassess U.S. credibility.\n* **Gold** **and Silver prices would skyrocket**, triggering a massive rush into tangible assets.\n* **Stock markets would face volatility**, as financial institutions scramble to adjust.\n\n# 2. Political & Institutional Trust Collapses\n\n* This would spark **investigations into past administrations**—who knew what, and when?\n* The Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury would face **severe public backlash**.\n* Conspiracy theories about missing gold would no longer be just theories—they’d become mainstream concerns.\n\n# 3. Global Economic & Geopolitical Shifts\n\n* **Countries like China and Russia, which have been increasing gold and silver reserves, could use this to push de-dollarization even harder.**\n* **U.S. debt credibility would be questioned**, as major bondholders may look for alternative safe havens.\n* The U.S. would lose leverage in global trade if confidence in its financial system eroded.\n\n# 4. Potential Criminal and Legal Consequences\n\n* If gold were missing, **who took it?** Was it secretly leased? Sold? Mismanaged?\n* This could lead to **massive legal battles** and public demands for accountability.\n\n# Why Trump & Elon Would Not Risk This If the Gold Wasn’t There\n\nGiven these risks, it’s **highly unlikely** that Trump and Elon would push for an audit without already knowing the gold is there. They both rely on market confidence—Trump for political and economic influence, and Elon for business growth.\n\nIf this audit were to cause *panic,* it would also:\n\n* Crush investor confidence in the U.S. financial system.\n* Increase borrowing costs for businesses.\n* Potentially trigger a recession, damaging both their interests.\n\nInstead, the **logical reason for the audit** is to **prove the gold is there**—which would:\n\n* **Reinforce trust in U.S. financial stability.**\n* **Strengthen the dollar amid global economic shifts.**\n* **Give Trump leverage over financial institutions.**\n* **Position the U.S. as a dominant force in the future of asset-backed finance.**\n\n# TL;DR - Final Thoughts – What’s the Real Endgame?\n\nIf this audit happens, it’s because they *already know* the reserves are intact, and they want the world to see it. Otherwise, they’d be opening Pandora’s box on a scale that even they couldn’t control.\n\nSo the real question isn’t **“Is the gold missing?”** but rather **“Why is proving it’s there strategically important right now?”**\n\nGenuinely curious of what you think, I’ll be watching this closely. What do you think—pure transparency move, or a calculated power play?",

When buying gold you pay some premium and buy for more than market value, i saw some discount options and the like, but as a whole it will be slightly above market price. But when you go to sell this, what rates do you get? What i saw online was a 10-20% markdown from market price. When you all buy gold, are you expecting to hold long enough to offset that? Or do you have other reasons for buying physical? It seems like a hard sell to me to immediately take a 20%L on an investment.\n\n2. I was reading some comments about which gold to buy (my current plan is costco, but that may change) and someone's suggestion was to save up and buy big smalls. As an outsider, you might see how this oxymoron is confusing. Could someone explain to me what they meant? Or what types of gold resell the best?\n\n3. It seems that different brands hold their value better? Why is that? Is it a gold purity level or something?\n\n4. I'd be happy to hear any other advice or suggestions for someone trying to get started, such as general safety precautions and the like. \n\nSorry for such a long post and thank you in advance!",

Also searched and read some posts in this community (you guys are awesome!) But would still love some opinions and suggestions. \n\nI understand that apmex has probably one of the highest premiums among online sites, but it seems like the biggest, and also authorized by US Mint as purchaser.\n\nDoes this mean it is near impossible to get fake coins from apmex and i can have peace of mind? \n\nAlso noticed that on some other sites, certified coins maybe of similar price to that of the uncertified coin on APMEX. So maybe certified coins from other reputable sites make sense too?\n\nI have never even seen an American gold eagle in person and am just a paranoid person when it comes to money... so i guess I am willing to pay extra 50 bucks for something worth 600+ if that can really make a difference in lowering my chances of getting fake gold coins from .1% to .01% \nThanks for any input!\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the suggestions! I am not trying to look for the cheapest coin (can get that info from findbullionprice), but more thinking about authenticity of the coins.

This family, very illegally and under threat of death, put this gold in the ground and never spoke of it….FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS.  About 1990 when ‘democracy’ came along they dug it up and were one of the wealthiest families in the area. 💎🤲🏻.\n\nThis is why I hold gold, you never know what’s coming.

        "text": "Hey everyone\n\nI’ve been holding onto some gold (50g bars and 1oz coins) for a while now, and I’ve been wondering if the soon-to-end war in Ukraine could lead to a drop in gold prices. Gold has been somewhat volatile recently, and with the geopolitical risks potentially easing, I’m concerned that it might fall in price once the war is officially over.\n\nI'm specifically wondering if now is a good time to sell or if I should hold on and ride out any short-term price dips. I know gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset in times of uncertainty, but if the war ends, it might signal stability, which could cause a drop in demand for gold.\n\nWhat do you think? Should I sell now to capitalize on higher prices, or do you think gold might still hold its value over the next few months despite the war's end?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!\n\n\nEdit:\nI forgot to mention that i dont live in a dollar or euro country.\n\nMy country currency got inflated by the war heavily.\n\nIn 2022 inflation was 14%\nIn 2023 inflation was 17.3%\n\nThe war is the biggest reason of this. Thats why im concerned. (I live in one of the countries that neighbor ukraine)\n\n\nCurrency went from\n 1$ = 323 HUF in january 2022 \n1$ = 320 HUF in january 2024\n",

        "text": "**Edit: Title should be \"Why Gold ETFs/ETRs are a scam\". But I can't change it.**\n\nWhat if I told you I had an investment opportunity? Hear me out.\n\nOil. I have 10 drums of oil and I will sell you stamps to receive one drum of oil. So you need 1,000 stamps per one drum of oil. It’s easier to own stamps right? You can then claim the physical oil drum with your stamps!\n\nBut each stamp when added up to 1,000 is a little bit more than the cost of one drum of oil, it’s a convenience cost. Okay, but we don’t accept 1,000 stamps, we need a minimum of 10,000 stamps from you. What? It’s cheaper to buy a set of 10 drums of oil than 10 individual drums separately because each stamp is based on the spot price of 1 drum?\n\nWell your stamp is based on the value of one drum and we need you to buy at least 10 drums, that’s the rule. Also those 10 drums are more than $400k in cost when you add them up, that’s the minimum you need to redeem your oil.\n\nAlso, we don’t actually keep the oil in drums. You’re going to need to pay 5% of the value of your 10,000 drums of oil for us to actually pour the oil into the drums, we call it the ‘fabrication fee’.\n\nOh yeah and it also costs money to transport them in an armoured courier, the ‘transport fee’. By the way, it also cost money to redeem the oil drums too, that’s obviously the ‘redemption fee’.\n\nBut don’t forget we also charge you a small % of money just to own these stamps each year we call that fee the ‘MER’. Even if you don’t redeem your oil, we still need to make sure we charge it.\n\nBut don’t worry, once you redeem you drums of oil, we definitely have them. We do audits to make sure that we do. But if a few of you redeem at once, because of…some reasons, we may take a few months to actually make them and give them to you if there’s a backlog. If you don’t want to wait we can just pay you back your money, but you’ll need to pay tax on that.\n\nNow who wants to buy?\n\nMoral of the story? It’s better to hold physical.\n\nEdit:\n\nReplace oil with gold & stamps with ETFs/ETR’s.",

        "text": "Hot on the heels of the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) recent resumption of official gold purchases (after a six-month pause), and amid ongoing economic turmoil domestically and trade-war threats geopolitically, Beijing has launched a pilot program  that allows insurers to buy gold for the first time could free up billions of dollars of investment in the metal, adding further impetus to a record-setting rally, hitting a new high (in USD) above $2900 this morning...\n\n\n\nAs Bloomberg reports, ten insurance firms - including PICC Property & Casualty Co. and China Life Insurance Co., two of China’s biggest - will be able to invest as much as 1% of their assets in bullion, in a program that became effective last Friday. \n\nThat would translate into a potential 200 billion yuan ($27.4 billion) of funds, Minsheng Securities Co. said in a note.\n\nThe shift in policy in China could be a signal that authorities recognize the dearth of investment options in Asia’s largest economy, and the need for alternatives amid a property downturn and an economic slump.\n\n“Insurance companies lack options for mid- and long-term assets with stable yields,” Guotai Junan Securities analysts led by Liu Xinqi said in a note, even though bullion typically doesn’t offer that.\n\nThe policy tweak makes gold the first commodity that Chinese insurers have been explicitly permitted to invest in. \n\nChina has restricted insurance funds from taking positions in assets without “stable cash returns,” and limits the amount they can put into bonds and stocks.\n\nAs Jesse Colombo concluded earlier, all signs point to the potential for another explosive gold rally driven by Chinese demand, much like what unfolded last spring. With SHFE gold futures breaking out, the possibility of rising trading volumes, and the return of a Chinese gold price premium, the conditions for another bullish episode are falling into place. China’s economic crisis, record-low bond yields, and the looming prospect of massive stimulus only strengthen the case for gold’s continued ascent. Meanwhile, the PBOC’s renewed gold purchases, alongside this new insurance-gold-purchasing pilot program reinforce the broader shift toward gold as a preferred asset\n\nIf these factors align as expected, the next phase of this bull market could be even more dramatic than what we saw in 2024.From zero hedge.",

JPMorgan has already capitalized on the widening spreads arranging for $4 billion in gold delivered to COMEX warehouses in February marking the second largest month delivery since 1994 according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Since November 2024, over 13.8 million troy ounces of gold have flowed into U.S. vaults, depleting London's available stock. Meanwhile, CME gold stocks in the U.S. increased by 12.2 million troy ounces—an impressive 70% rise over just two months. As a result, the world’s largest bullion market is now experiencing a shortage not seen in decades.",

Over the past two months, these precious metals have outperformed bitcoin, which was the best performing asset in 2024, and equity markets around the world. Gold looks positioned to easily top $3,000 in coming weeks, with silver similarly hitting all-time highs.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons to believe that gold prices have further to run from here. Some of the biggest factors supporting a higher gold price include the ongoing accumulation of gold by central banks, persistent inflation, and a global supply shortage of physical gold.\n\nCentral banks, which hold as much as 20 percent of total global gold reserves, are key to the long-term growth in demand for the metal. In recent years, central banks around the world have been accumulating substantial quantities of gold. Net central bank acquisitions of gold topped 1,045 metric tons in 2024, marking the third year in a row of purchases above 1,000 metric tons. These figures reflect the publicly disclosed amounts; many observers believe that China and other countries are secretly acquiring gold well in excess of reported volumes. Most of the buying has come from outside of the United States and Western Europe. The four largest sovereign holders, the United States, Germany, France, and Italy, have been the exception to the gold rush led by the BRICS and other developing nations, and have not acquired additional reserve.By The Epoch Times.",

        "text": "There is a shortage of physical gold. The London Bullion Market Association is the center of gold trading around the world. Many nations have historically held their gold reserves with the Bank of England, but in recent years have been repatriating their holdings. This has disrupted the London markets and put pressure on prices.\n\nIn recent weeks, demand for delivery of physical gold has skyrocketed. Geopolitical concerns have led to a massive movement of physical gold out of the UK and Europe into vaults in New York and elsewhere. This has led to shortages and speculation of price manipulation. European markets have been spooked by President Trump’s saber-rattling over tariffs, and price differentials have opened up between gold markets across the Atlantic, accelerating the movement of bullion into the United States.\n\nThis spike in demand for physical gold, and resulting logistical bottlenecks, are not only pressuring gold prices but potentially creating a demand spiral. Analogous to a deposit run on a bank, gold customers concerned about the security of their holdings may accelerate demands to withdraw them. This could further squeeze physical supply and quickly boost prices. Many gold derivative contracts are linked to underlying physical collateral. If this collateral can’t be secured, the contracts can fail. This is one reason why holding physical gold is vastly superior to exchange-traded funds or other investment contracts that can’t guarantee delivery of the collateral on demand.\n\nSome gold industry observers have argued that there is evidence that the handful of large banks that issue most of the gold derivatives contracts have acted in concert to manipulate the price of gold. An illegal pricing cartel among the banks would not be unprecedented. The public discovered similar practices in the mortgage securities fraud leading up to the global financial crisis and in the manipulation of LIBOR (the interest rate at which banks lend to one another) uncovered a few years later.\n\nThe recent sharp rise in gold prices may put pressure on these banks and lead to instability in any price fixing arrangement. If the cartel unwinds, it could come quickly and violently. There would be winners and losers, and potential contagion into other markets. In other words, gold derivatives may become the epicenter of the next financial crisis. In such an event, demand for physical gold would spike further, as would prices.\n\nViews expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times or ZeroHedge.\n\n",

        "text": "This is a follow-up to my earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/1iv0pes/fort_knox_gold_audit_whats_the_real_play_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), where I was talking about the intent of opening up Fort Knox - was it really what was showcased as an audit of gold or just a smoke screen? A fellow redditor had made a point, which was a strong case for me to further research situations where a currency collapses – what happens to lenders (in current case, holders of TBills), everyday citizens and what not. So, I went to look for the case with Germany.\n\n  \n**Germany’s Currency Before WWI: A Strong and Stable Mark**\n\nBefore World War I, the German mark was one of the strongest currencies in the world. Germany was a rising industrial and economic power, competing directly with Britain and the United States. The Reichsmark was backed by gold, and its value remained stable due to prudent fiscal policies and Germany’s growing export economy.\n\nAt the time, 1 gold-backed German mark was roughly equivalent to $0.25 USD, which was a significant amount of purchasing power. Germany had a strong banking system, and its trade surplus helped maintain confidence in the currency. But World War I changed everything.\n\n**The Currency Collapse Between WWI and WWII**\n\nWhen Germany entered WWI (1914-1918), the government suspended the gold standard to finance the war. Instead of taxing its citizens, Germany printed massive amounts of paper money, assuming that it would win the war and repay its debts using reparations from defeated nations. What happened next? Germany lost the war and was forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which imposed 132 billion gold marks in reparations. The German government kept printing money to pay for war debts and reparations instead of finding sustainable revenue sources. By 1923, hyperinflation had completely destroyed the mark—at its peak, prices doubled every few hours.\n\nTo put it in perspective, in 1914, 1 USD was equal to 4 German marks but in 1923, 1 USD was at 4.2 trillion marks\n\nThis meant that workers were paid multiple times a day because their wages lost value within hours. People burned money for heat because it was cheaper than firewood. This economic catastrophe destroyed the German middle class and created deep resentment, laying the groundwork for the rise of Adolf Hitler.\n\n **Stabilization: The Dawes Plan, Young Plan & the Rise of Hitler**\n\nAfter hyperinflation, Germany introduced a new currency—the Rentenmark (1924)—which was backed by land and industrial goods instead of gold. The Dawes Plan (1924), funded mostly by U.S. banks, helped stabilize the economy by reducing reparation payments and injecting loans into German industry. Germany received an initial loan of 800 million marks, mostly from U.S. banks (e.g., J.P. Morgan & Co.). These loans helped stabilize Germany’s economy, rebuild infrastructure, and support industry. The German central bank (Reichsbank) was placed under international supervision to ensure financial discipline.\n\nBy 1929, the Young Plan further restructured German debt, but then came the Great Depression. The U.S. stock market crashed, cutting off financial support to Germany. Unemployment skyrocketed, and desperation led people to embrace radical political change—this was when Hitler gained momentum. Unlike the Dawes Plan, the Young Plan removed international control over the Reichsbank and German economy. By 1931, Germany was unable to continue payments, and international banks suffered losses. In 1932, the Lausanne Conference officially canceled most of Germany’s remaining reparations.\n\nBy 1933, Hitler completely abandoned all reparation payments, introduced the Reichsmark, and pushed Germany into military expansion, setting the stage for World War II.\n\n**The Role of Gold in Germany’s Economic Collapse**\n\nGold played an interesting role in this entire saga. Before WWI, the mark was backed by gold, ensuring stability. During WWI, Germany abandoned the gold standard, leading to reckless money printing. After hyperinflation, the new currency had to be backed by tangible assets (land & industry) instead of gold because the reserves were too depleted. When Hitler came to power, Germany began hoarding gold again, acquiring it through trade manipulation, looting, and war conquests. In short, the presence (or absence) of gold determined the fate of the German economy at every major turning point.\n\n**Parallels to the U.S. Dollar Today**\n\nFast forward to today, and we’re seeing some eerie similarities between the German mark’s downfall and the current state of the U.S. dollar.\n\nMassive Debt & Deficits - The U.S. national debt is now over $34 trillion, with annual deficits exceeding $2 trillion. The U.S. government relies on printing money and borrowing, similar to Germany post-WWI.\n\nRising Interest Payments - The U.S. now spends more on interest payments than on defense or Medicare. As interest rates rise, debt compounds faster, making repayment nearly impossible.\n\nForeign Holders of U.S. Debt - China, Japan, and other nations hold trillions in U.S. Treasury bonds. If they lose confidence in the dollar and start selling off debt, the U.S. could face a crisis similar to Germany’s post-WWI foreign debt crisis.\n\nDe-Dollarization - Many countries, including China, Russia, and BRICS nations, are moving away from the U.S. dollar for trade. If global confidence in the dollar collapses, hyperinflation is a real possibility, just like Germany in 1923.\n\nThe Role of Gold - Unlike in 1971 (when Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard), central banks today are hoarding gold at record levels. Countries like China, India and Russia are aggressively buying gold, preparing for a post-dollar world. If the dollar collapses, gold will once again be the ultimate store of value, just like it was during the German crises.\n\n**So, What Happens If the U.S. Dollar Collapses?**\n\nIf history repeats itself, the U.S. could face a stage of hyperinflation, making basic goods unaffordable for the average person. There would be massive economic and political upheaval, leading to radical changes in government policies and we could expect a shift to alternative stores of value, like gold, silver, Bitcoin, or a new international reserve currency. Finally, a potential loss of U.S. global dominance would mean other nations push for a multi-currency world order.\n\n**So what next?**\n\nHistory doesn’t repeat itself exactly, but the patterns are clear. Germany's currency collapse was a warning about the dangers of reckless money printing, excessive debt, and foreign reliance. The U.S. is not immune to these same forces.\n\nThese are my questions for a discussion to fellow redditors: \n\n1. **What do you think would happen to countries that hold US dollars (either as reserve currency or as T-Bills)? Will US default like Germany and finally have its debt cancelled by magic?**\n2. **What happens to our incomes? Does it mean our wages now go up in numbers (though not in value)?**\n3. **Finally, when Gold becomes a standard again, do you anticipate Executive Order 6102 in US to Banking Act of 1959 in Australia to Gold Ban act in 1966 in UK to Gold Control Act in India in 1968 and so on, to restrict private ownership of gold?**",

        "text": "All this talk of auditing Fort Knox for the first time in 50 years, a bitcoin reserve, revaluing gold, etc. has got me thinking about a few things. Gold has been viewed as money for over 5000 years, fiat currencies average a lifespan of 200, and bitcoin for roughly 15. The total market capitalization of Gold at this point is roughly $20 trillion, bitcoin is 10% the size of that at $2 trillion. All the major central banks in the world already have a gold position in their reserves, whereas bitcoin doesn’t. The United States of America is the reserve currency of the world and the US treasury can revalue gold at any point,  if they want to play that card. Gold is good insurance for fiat destruction through inflation, stays boring and isn’t typically sexy. If it is sexy, that means that your Country’s fiat is being destroyed. Bitcoin on the other hand is speculative, and super sexy. Remove the annual 30% returns and that speculative money will flow to other speculative investments. The community that’s investing in gold is dramatically different than the community that’s investing in bitcoin, and I really don’t think the two should be compared in the same room. One community is buying Insurance, the other is buying the chance to 10x their money on the roulette table. The last thing I’ll say about bitcoin is that with quantum computing in the next 10 years the btc code would be cracked rendering it useless, whereas whatever central banks wanna do with a gold backed national currency in the future, is still within the realms of infinite possibilities.

        "title": "Fort Knox Gold Audit: What’s the Real Play Here?",
        "text": "As someone who has always loved the shine of both Silver and Gold, I’ve seen countless debates about the U.S. gold reserves—especially regarding Fort Knox. Now, with reports that Trump and Elon Musk may push for an official audit, the implications of such a move need to be carefully considered.\n\nWhile transparency is valuable, an audit of this magnitude is a *high-stakes* play that could have profound consequences. If the gold is *not* there, the fallout could be catastrophic. But here’s the key point: **Trump and Elon would only push for this if they were certain the gold is accounted for.**\n\n# If the Gold Is Missing—What Happens?\n\n# 1. The Dollar Takes a Major Hit\n\nWhile the U.S. dollar is no longer backed by gold, its strength is underpinned by confidence in U.S. financial stability. If an audit were to reveal that Fort Knox is missing significant reserves:\n\n* **The dollar could devalue quickly** as global markets reassess U.S. credibility.\n* **Gold** **and Silver prices would skyrocket**, triggering a massive rush into tangible assets.\n* **Stock markets would face volatility**, as financial institutions scramble to adjust.\n\n# 2. Political & Institutional Trust Collapses\n\n* This would spark **investigations into past administrations**—who knew what, and when?\n* The Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury would face **severe public backlash**.\n* Conspiracy theories about missing gold would no longer be just theories—they’d become mainstream concerns.\n\n# 3. Global Economic & Geopolitical Shifts\n\n* **Countries like China and Russia, which have been increasing gold and silver reserves, could use this to push de-dollarization even harder.**\n* **U.S. debt credibility would be questioned**, as major bondholders may look for alternative safe havens.\n* The U.S. would lose leverage in global trade if confidence in its financial system eroded.\n\n# 4. Potential Criminal and Legal Consequences\n\n* If gold were missing, **who took it?** Was it secretly leased? Sold? Mismanaged?\n* This could lead to **massive legal battles** and public demands for accountability.\n\n# Why Trump & Elon Would Not Risk This If the Gold Wasn’t There\n\nGiven these risks, it’s **highly unlikely** that Trump and Elon would push for an audit without already knowing the gold is there. They both rely on market confidence—Trump for political and economic influence, and Elon for business growth.\n\nIf this audit were to cause *panic,* it would also:\n\n* Crush investor confidence in the U.S. financial system.\n* Increase borrowing costs for businesses.\n* Potentially trigger a recession, damaging both their interests.\n\nInstead, the **logical reason for the audit** is to **prove the gold is there**—which would:\n\n* **Reinforce trust in U.S. financial stability.**\n* **Strengthen the dollar amid global economic shifts.**\n* **Give Trump leverage over financial institutions.**\n* **Position the U.S. as a dominant force in the future of asset-backed finance.**\n\n# TL;DR - Final Thoughts – What’s the Real Endgame?\n\nIf this audit happens, it’s because they *already know* the reserves are intact, and they want the world to see it. Otherwise, they’d be opening Pandora’s box on a scale that even they couldn’t control.\n\nSo the real question isn’t **“Is the gold missing?”** but rather **“Why is proving it’s there strategically important right now?”**\n\nGenuinely curious of what you think, I’ll be watching this closely. What do you think—pure transparency move, or a calculated power play?",

When buying gold you pay some premium and buy for more than market value, i saw some discount options and the like, but as a whole it will be slightly above market price. But when you go to sell this, what rates do you get? What i saw online was a 10-20% markdown from market price. When you all buy gold, are you expecting to hold long enough to offset that? Or do you have other reasons for buying physical? It seems like a hard sell to me to immediately take a 20%L on an investment.\n\n2. I was reading some comments about which gold to buy (my current plan is costco, but that may change) and someone's suggestion was to save up and buy big smalls. As an outsider, you might see how this oxymoron is confusing. Could someone explain to me what they meant? Or what types of gold resell the best?\n\n3. It seems that different brands hold their value better? Why is that? Is it a gold purity level or something?\n\n4. I'd be happy to hear any other advice or suggestions for someone trying to get started, such as general safety precautions and the like. \n\nSorry for such a long post and thank you in advance!",

        "text": "Hot on the heels of the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) recent resumption of official gold purchases (after a six-month pause), and amid ongoing economic turmoil domestically and trade-war threats geopolitically, Beijing has launched a pilot program  that allows insurers to buy gold for the first time could free up billions of dollars of investment in the metal, adding further impetus to a record-setting rally, hitting a new high (in USD) above $2900 this morning...\n\n\n\nAs Bloomberg reports, ten insurance firms - including PICC Property & Casualty Co. and China Life Insurance Co., two of China’s biggest - will be able to invest as much as 1% of their assets in bullion, in a program that became effective last Friday. \n\nThat would translate into a potential 200 billion yuan ($27.4 billion) of funds, Minsheng Securities Co. said in a note.\n\nThe shift in policy in China could be a signal that authorities recognize the dearth of investment options in Asia’s largest economy, and the need for alternatives amid a property downturn and an economic slump.\n\n“Insurance companies lack options for mid- and long-term assets with stable yields,” Guotai Junan Securities analysts led by Liu Xinqi said in a note, even though bullion typically doesn’t offer that.\n\nThe policy tweak makes gold the first commodity that Chinese insurers have been explicitly permitted to invest in. \n\nChina has restricted insurance funds from taking positions in assets without “stable cash returns,” and limits the amount they can put into bonds and stocks.\n\nAs Jesse Colombo concluded earlier, all signs point to the potential for another explosive gold rally driven by Chinese demand, much like what unfolded last spring. With SHFE gold futures breaking out, the possibility of rising trading volumes, and the return of a Chinese gold price premium, the conditions for another bullish episode are falling into place. China’s economic crisis, record-low bond yields, and the looming prospect of massive stimulus only strengthen the case for gold’s continued ascent. Meanwhile, the PBOC’s renewed gold purchases, alongside this new insurance-gold-purchasing pilot program reinforce the broader shift toward gold as a preferred asset\n\nIf these factors align as expected, the next phase of this bull market could be even more dramatic than what we saw in 2024.From zero hedge.",

        "text": "Hi everybody! Just looking for some insight on a subject I couldn’t find many recent threads on.\n\nMy partner and I are in the process of starting a brick and mortar “cash for gold” business in the heart of downtown of a 2.5M population American city who’s main industry is tourism. We’ve applied for all the necessary licenses and permits, have sufficient liquid assets to bankroll our startup, have purchased a portable XRF machine (Thermo Fisher Niton XL2), own the property and office space outright where our business will be located, etc.\n\nWhat is the viability of this type of business in 2025? From what little I’ve read on this, I know that marketing is probably the biggest factor in terms of who is successful and who is not. We plan on heavily marketing the business online using pay-per-click ad campaigns. We’ve designed our location to be very competitive as far as attracting customers. For example: our central downtown location will be built into an existing Criminal Defense law firm. 95% of that firm’s clients pay cash up front to retain representation for their legal matters. The idea is to offer the gold buying service as a financing option to clients who might otherwise have to obtain money from their friends or family in order to hire an attorney.\n\nAs I said earlier, we will also be investing in other marketing options to reach potential new clients, especially (if not exclusively) online.\n\nAs far as security is concerned, we are taking a small private office located inside the law firm and converting it to be a secure space complete with bulletproof wall panels, a walk-up “bank teller” style window with adequate ballistic glass for handling all transactions, and a controlled entry ballistic grade door. Cameras are already installed at various positions throughout the entire law office building and additional cameras will be installed to cover the secure office space where the gold/cash transactions will occur. Inside the 12x10 foot secure room will be the XRF machine, a computer and printer, a large safe, scales, etc. Also of major note is the fact that two, armed security guards patrol the law building during business hours and, once we open for business, one of the guards’ duties will be tailored to patrol and oversee primarily the law office’s reception area and the controlled access hallway leading up to the bank-style teller window and C4G office door. Keep in mind that there are about 100 law office personnel working in offices within the same building as the cash for gold office.\n\nWhat am I missing? Any advice as to equipment, additional security measures, marketing?\n\nThere are two competing cash for gold locations within 1-2 blocks of us. One is a pawnshop.\n\nThanks in advance for your attention and advice!",

        "text": "Ongoing Gold & Silver Short Squeeze Continues\nFebruary 6 (King World News) – James Turk:  The new year has opened with a bang, Eric, and I expect the good news for gold and silver bulls to continue — provided you own physical metal, which means we need to discuss this ongoing squeeze of short positions in gold and silver that is receiving a lot of media attention. \n\nTariffs are being bandied about as the cause, but I think there is more to it because it is not logical or profitable to delay delivery on short positions.\n\nDecades ago when I first started trading futures, deliveries by the shorts were made on or near what is called First Notice Day. It is always advantageous for the shorts to deliver as soon as possible, but they have to wait for FND. These dates are announced by Comex years in advance.\n\nThe shorts want to deliver because they want to get rid of the metal they sold in advance through futures or forwards and get paid for the metal they are selling. Those dollars they receive from the sale/delivery could then be spent or invested to earn interest, so there is no reason to hold off on meeting their delivery obligation. \n\nAlso, once the metal is delivered, the buyer now pays the metal’s storage. That cost savings is another advantage for the shorts to deliver as soon as possible on or immediately after FND. And that’s the way it works in normal markets. \n\nSo the delays to deliver physical metal – which news reports are saying is several weeks – is not normal. But it is not tariffs that are causing these distortions in my view. \n\nIt’s happening because there are vastly more promises to deliver gold than there is physical metal available at current prices, and maybe even more promises than there is existent gold. The same is true for silver. \n\nConsider this comment in London’s Financial Times. The flow physical of physical metal out of London to New York:\n\n“is causing disruption to the gold market, and has increased the cost of borrowing gold.”\n\nLet’s unpack this sentence. If you are short gold and need to deliver, you must deliver. If you don’t, you default, which could put you or your business if you are a dealer into bankruptcy. That’s what happened to Volume Investors back in 1985, but its collapse was an isolated event with limited knock-on affect.\n\nVolume Investors failed to deliver cash on a margin call, but dollars can be easily borrowed if you are creditworthy (Volume Investors wasn’t). Banks create dollars when they make a loan, but banks cannot conjure up physical gold and silver. So metals have to be borrowed from existent stock, and the shorts are discovering that physical metal is being held by strong hands unwilling to lend their gold – even at these abnormally high interest rates – because they don’t want to take the risk of dealer defaults and never seeing their gold again.\n\nBut there is also another type of strong hands. It is the holders of physical metal unwilling to sell at current prices because they expect prices to rise much further. It’s the same thing that happened in the 1930s. People moved their purchasing power (money) out of banks into paper currency initially, and then as those promises became doubted, out of dollars into gold. The fractional reserve system of more gold promises than existent physical metal is contracting. \n\nSo the shorts have a serious problem, Eric, that is apparent in this gold chart. \n\nKing World News note: The lack of available physical gold has kept pullbacks in the gold market very shallow, despite the blistering upside move from $1,800 to $2,900\n\n\n\nGold had been stair-stepping higher throughout 2024 until a brief shakeout in November. That drop was probably engineered by the shorts because they knew what was coming. So they were no doubt hoping to pick up some physical metal before getting squeezed, which began in earnest during December deliveries.\n\nThat month the shorts – namely the dealers – discovered that it was a hard sell to convince buyers to roll their position into some London paper gold scheme, even when offered enticing rates. Since December the squeeze on shorts has tightened, and as the chart shows, gold is rocketing higher.Written by James Turk.",

Now, the increased likelihood of a U.S.-led trade war is further boosting safe-haven bids.\n\n“It’s also accelerating the flood of metal into New York warehouses, keeping London vaults exceptionally busy trucking metal to Heathrow,” Ash said.\n\nThe market turmoil has prompted investors to seek out safe havens and most will head for gold, argued Pepperstone’s Michael Brown. Given inflation risks, U.S. Treasuries probably aren’t the best choice for a safe haven, while foreign-exchange markets will continue to be roiled by trade headlines, he wrote.\n\nBeyond the near-term risk of a selloff to cover losses in equity markets, the tariffs reinforce the medium-term bull case for gold, JPMorgan analysts said in a note.\n\nTrump’s tariffs point to a much more disruptive policy approach with increased economic growth concerns and higher inflation risks, all boosting gold’s hedge appeal, JPM said.",

On the last trading day, gold briefly broke above the $2800 level but ultimately closed below it.  \n\n🔍 Market Psychology Insight:  \nA significant number of retail traders have been heavily positioned on the buy side since the beginning of the year—not just near the all-time high, but consistently throughout January. This aligns with the typical New Year psychology, where fresh capital enters the market, and the majority tends to favor buying.  \n\n⚠️ Overbought Conditions & Liquidity Traps:  \nI see a considerable amount of retail stop-loss liquidity in the market, indicating that gold is currently in an overbought zone and in need of a strong correction.  \n\n📆 Monday's Market Expectation:  \nI anticipate another breakout attempt above $2800, likely triggering further retail buying, as traders perceive it as the first bullish move of February. However, my focus will be on targeting those stop-loss levels, as I remain bearish on gold in the near term.  \n\n📉 Bearish Outlook Moving Forward:  \nAs long as gold remains below January’s monthly candle high, my overall bias remains bearish. While my long-term target on the sell side is extensive, market conditions will dictate the strategy moving forward.  \n\n✅ January was a highly successful trading month!

        "text": "If you’ve spent any time in the world of gold and silver, you’ve probably noticed there are *distinct* personalities in this space. Whether you’re at a coin shop, a Reddit thread, or a gold convention, chances are you’ve run into all four of these types:\n\n# 🪙 Type 1: The Sound Money Purist (a.k.a. “Gold is Real Money” Guy)\n\nThese folks don’t just stack gold—they *preach* it. To them, **gold and silver are the only real money**. Everything else? Fake. Fiat currency? A scam. The Federal Reserve? A Ponzi scheme. Their dream? **Bringing back the gold standard and watching fiat burn.** They likely own a copy of *The Creature from Jekyll Island*, have strong opinions on central banking, and believe that every economic collapse is just one step closer to their “I told you so” moment.\n\n# 💰 Type 2: The Hardcore Stacker (“Premiums? I’d Rather Die”)\n\nFor this person, **gold is wealth preservation**, plain and simple. They’re here to **protect their purchasing power**, not start a revolution. They’re laser-focused on **weight, spot price, and premiums**—and if you overpaid by even a few bucks, trust me, they’ll let you know. To them, **gold is gold**—doesn’t matter if it’s a Maple Leaf, a Krugerrand, or a scratched-up bar with bite marks from the last guy who tested it. If it’s the cheapest per ounce, it’s **good enough**.\n\n# 🧐 Type 3: The Numismatist (“Yes, But Is It Rare?”)\n\nThey’re not just stacking metal—they’re **hunting treasure**. This person loves the thrill of **finding rare coins, limited mintages, and historical pieces**. They’ll gladly pay **10x spot price** if it means securing a **low-population MS-70 from a forgotten 19th-century mint**. They obsess over coin grading, mint errors, and market trends, and while you’re hoarding bullion, they’re out here flipping **high-premium rarities** for insane profits—or holding onto them as *future* grail pieces.\n\n# ✨ Type 4: The Gold Aestheticist (“It’s Just Beautiful, Okay?”)\n\nSome people stack gold for its monetary value—these people stack it because **it’s stunning**. They don’t care about premiums, numismatics, or economic theories. They just love **gold**—the weight, the shine, the sheer beauty of it. Maybe they collect jewelry, maybe they just like to admire their coins under perfect lighting. Either way, their stack isn’t just an investment, it’s a **work of art**.\n\n**So, which one are you?** Or are you a mix of a few? No matter where you fall, we’re all here for the love of gold—whether it’s for wealth, history, security, or just pure admiration. **Drop a comment and tell us your type!** 🏆💰✨",

President Trump has committed to auditing the U.S. government’s gold stockpile, officially on the books at 8,133 metric tons, for the first time in half a century.

        "text": "There is a shortage of physical gold. The London Bullion Market Association is the center of gold trading around the world. Many nations have historically held their gold reserves with the Bank of England, but in recent years have been repatriating their holdings. This has disrupted the London markets and put pressure on prices.\n\nIn recent weeks, demand for delivery of physical gold has skyrocketed. Geopolitical concerns have led to a massive movement of physical gold out of the UK and Europe into vaults in New York and elsewhere. This has led to shortages and speculation of price manipulation. European markets have been spooked by President Trump’s saber-rattling over tariffs, and price differentials have opened up between gold markets across the Atlantic, accelerating the movement of bullion into the United States.\n\nThis spike in demand for physical gold, and resulting logistical bottlenecks, are not only pressuring gold prices but potentially creating a demand spiral. Analogous to a deposit run on a bank, gold customers concerned about the security of their holdings may accelerate demands to withdraw them. This could further squeeze physical supply and quickly boost prices. Many gold derivative contracts are linked to underlying physical collateral. If this collateral can’t be secured, the contracts can fail. This is one reason why holding physical gold is vastly superior to exchange-traded funds or other investment contracts that can’t guarantee delivery of the collateral on demand.\n\nSome gold industry observers have argued that there is evidence that the handful of large banks that issue most of the gold derivatives contracts have acted in concert to manipulate the price of gold. An illegal pricing cartel among the banks would not be unprecedented. The public discovered similar practices in the mortgage securities fraud leading up to the global financial crisis and in the manipulation of LIBOR (the interest rate at which banks lend to one another) uncovered a few years later.\n\nThe recent sharp rise in gold prices may put pressure on these banks and lead to instability in any price fixing arrangement. If the cartel unwinds, it could come quickly and violently. There would be winners and losers, and potential contagion into other markets. In other words, gold derivatives may become the epicenter of the next financial crisis. In such an event, demand for physical gold would spike further, as would prices.\n\nViews expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times or ZeroHedge.\n\n",

Either spend at the grocery store and gym or at the pharmacy and hospital.\n\n-My own business is what generates the income to buy gold and being good at a craft or professional area makes me feel competent and accomplished and I enjoy helping others thru it, including employing them.\n\n-The purpose, for me, of being financially stable is to be able to enjoy loving and being loved by others. So, investing in those relationships is the end to my means (plus, you get great business tips, sometimes, too)\n\n-Faith because, eternity is far long than the 80+ years I hope to be on earth, and as the Bible says, unless God is the one ultimately guarding the City, then the watchmen labor in vain… \n\n—————————————————\n\nI do also “invest” “play money” in stocks, but never anything that I or my family will miss, if I lose. So far, things have gone well there, too, and it’s “fun” to play the market, when I don’t have any fears of losing the money.\n\n",

I know both have their benefits, but I’m trying to figure out which one would be a better investment.\n\nGold seems like the more well-known option, and I’ve heard it’s more stable, but silver is a lot cheaper per ounce and seems like it could have more room to grow. I’m curious about the pros and cons of each.\n\nFor someone just starting out, should I lean towards one over the other, or does it just depend on my goals? Would love to hear your experiences and thoughts!",

        "text": "All this talk of auditing Fort Knox for the first time in 50 years, a bitcoin reserve, revaluing gold, etc. has got me thinking about a few things. Gold has been viewed as money for over 5000 years, fiat currencies average a lifespan of 200, and bitcoin for roughly 15. The total market capitalization of Gold at this point is roughly $20 trillion, bitcoin is 10% the size of that at $2 trillion. All the major central banks in the world already have a gold position in their reserves, whereas bitcoin doesn’t. The United States of America is the reserve currency of the world and the US treasury can revalue gold at any point,  if they want to play that card. Gold is good insurance for fiat destruction through inflation, stays boring and isn’t typically sexy. If it is sexy, that means that your Country’s fiat is being destroyed. Bitcoin on the other hand is speculative, and super sexy. Remove the annual 30% returns and that speculative money will flow to other speculative investments. The community that’s investing in gold is dramatically different than the community that’s investing in bitcoin, and I really don’t think the two should be compared in the same room. One community is buying Insurance, the other is buying the chance to 10x their money on the roulette table. The last thing I’ll say about bitcoin is that with quantum computing in the next 10 years the btc code would be cracked rendering it useless, whereas whatever central banks wanna do with a gold backed national currency in the future, is still within the realms of infinite possibilities.

When buying gold you pay some premium and buy for more than market value, i saw some discount options and the like, but as a whole it will be slightly above market price. But when you go to sell this, what rates do you get? What i saw online was a 10-20% markdown from market price. When you all buy gold, are you expecting to hold long enough to offset that? Or do you have other reasons for buying physical? It seems like a hard sell to me to immediately take a 20%L on an investment.\n\n2. I was reading some comments about which gold to buy (my current plan is costco, but that may change) and someone's suggestion was to save up and buy big smalls. As an outsider, you might see how this oxymoron is confusing. Could someone explain to me what they meant? Or what types of gold resell the best?\n\n3. It seems that different brands hold their value better? Why is that? Is it a gold purity level or something?\n\n4. I'd be happy to hear any other advice or suggestions for someone trying to get started, such as general safety precautions and the like. \n\nSorry for such a long post and thank you in advance!",

But after that, it's been used more as just a commodity that doesn't often get spent or used in transactions.\n\nEven when people do \"use\" gold, they often exchange it for fiat, which isn't always ideal because some places charge taxes for it, and the fiat currency could end up being worth a lot less, depending which currency and at what time.\n\nI love gold, and I find it very alluring.

I'm not trying to invest or anything, I just like cute jewelry and gold, but I've never been able to save before now, so I'm completely new to this and don't want to ask anyone around me (because I think it's a bit awkward to be 22 asking about how much a small heart-shaped necklace should cost).\n\nI found [this necklace online](https://alsofreedom.com/products/14k-sweetheart-floating-necklace) that I really like, but I'm unsure of how I'm supposed to value it. It says it's 14k, but like a lot of online gold jewelry listings, it doesn't say how many grams it is, or what material is inside the plating, so I'm a little confused and would appreciate help –– not just for this necklace, but how to value online jewelry in general so that I don't get ripped off. Thank you <3",

        "text": "**Edit: Title should be \"Why Gold ETFs/ETRs are a scam\". But I can't change it.**\n\nWhat if I told you I had an investment opportunity? Hear me out.\n\nOil. I have 10 drums of oil and I will sell you stamps to receive one drum of oil. So you need 1,000 stamps per one drum of oil. It’s easier to own stamps right? You can then claim the physical oil drum with your stamps!\n\nBut each stamp when added up to 1,000 is a little bit more than the cost of one drum of oil, it’s a convenience cost. Okay, but we don’t accept 1,000 stamps, we need a minimum of 10,000 stamps from you. What? It’s cheaper to buy a set of 10 drums of oil than 10 individual drums separately because each stamp is based on the spot price of 1 drum?\n\nWell your stamp is based on the value of one drum and we need you to buy at least 10 drums, that’s the rule. Also those 10 drums are more than $400k in cost when you add them up, that’s the minimum you need to redeem your oil.\n\nAlso, we don’t actually keep the oil in drums. You’re going to need to pay 5% of the value of your 10,000 drums of oil for us to actually pour the oil into the drums, we call it the ‘fabrication fee’.\n\nOh yeah and it also costs money to transport them in an armoured courier, the ‘transport fee’. By the way, it also cost money to redeem the oil drums too, that’s obviously the ‘redemption fee’.\n\nBut don’t forget we also charge you a small % of money just to own these stamps each year we call that fee the ‘MER’. Even if you don’t redeem your oil, we still need to make sure we charge it.\n\nBut don’t worry, once you redeem you drums of oil, we definitely have them. We do audits to make sure that we do. But if a few of you redeem at once, because of…some reasons, we may take a few months to actually make them and give them to you if there’s a backlog. If you don’t want to wait we can just pay you back your money, but you’ll need to pay tax on that.\n\nNow who wants to buy?\n\nMoral of the story? It’s better to hold physical.\n\nEdit:\n\nReplace oil with gold & stamps with ETFs/ETR’s.",

        "text": "Recently Yves Smith from Naked Capitalism published an article by Richard Murphy making the case that [Governments should not hold BitCoin](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/01/should-the-government-be-allowed-to-hold-bitcoin.html).  I wrote a reply to the effect that the word bitcoin could be replaced everywhere in the article with the word gold and the article would have a much different slant.  I thought I would post my reply here both to generate discussion and to preserve my thoughts as Dr. Smith has shut off the comments section. She may yet decide to delete all my comments. I hope I wasn't directly responsible for that.  \n\nHere is what I wrote:  \n\n\n\n>  I did a little exercise of replacing all instances of bitcoin with gold in the above text. I was going to paste it here but I’m pretty sure nobody will read it. Maybe you can explain to me how gold and bitcoin are different? In light of the relentless shrill arguments in favor of using only cash to avoid government scrutiny that I keep getting from this web site it seems kind of contradictory. You hate bitcoin. I get it. There is a lot to hate there. My base case for many years is that the developed world would use financial repression to inflate away debt of as much as 400% of GDP. Russell Napier has a whole song and dance about this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyYXqeF7De8\n\n>  It puzzled me how everything hadn’t fallen down and gone boom long ago until a few days ago I came across this guy Michael Howell:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHFPRnMhX2A\n\n>  He explains patiently that absolute debt levels don’t matter anymore because paying down debt is passé. Nowadays we make minimum payments on loans. My experience of running up un-payable credit card debt in university showed me what will happen. The end game is hyperinflation not financial repression.\n\n>  Incidentally Russell Napier thinks that Bitcoin will be banned, precisely because it allows one to circumvent government efforts to do financial repression. He doesn’t think gold will be banned. I think that is amusingly short sighted. Governments operate for the benefit of the rich. A lot of gold is owned by poor people in India. They will not let poor people benefit from currency revaluation (fast or slow).\n   \n\nThis is Dr. Smith's reply:  \n\n\n\n*Sigh*\n\n>  Is this serious? Gold has real world uses such as in industry, dentistry (gold restorations are the best, the most like original tooth but hard to do so dentists don’t bother) and for jewelry. Bitcoin does not. And it consumes enormous amounts of energy.\n  \n\nI did write a perfunctory reply to this but in retrospect I was too hasty.  I was kind of put off by Dr. Smith's  attitude so I didn't feel like doing research.  This is an effort to put all this on a more solid footing:  \n\n*  First we have to understand the difference between a monetary metal and an industrial metal. A monetary metal is, be definition, one that has no use value. It derives it's value from \"salience\".  That means that people have collectively decided that gold is a thing of value.  There is nothing else that goes into it.  Years ago banks held silver as a monetary metal. In 1873 after more than 4000 years they decided that silver was no longer an item of value.  This happened principally because silver had become an industrial metal.  There was another reason but I will get back to it.  \n\n*  It would be disingenuous to say that gold has no industrial uses.  Clearly gold is very important to the electronics industry.  Statista breaks down world gold uses like so:  10% industrial, 50% jewelry, 40% investment.  My research tells me that about 80% of this jewelry demand is actually investment purchases by women in the far east.  That still leaves about 10% that is jewelry purchases that are not directly or indirectly for investment purposes.  I have a wedding ring made of gold.  I don't ever intend to sell it but I am aware that it has some resale value.  I think that all gold jewelry is implicitly an investment.   It strikes me that central banks are shaking in their boots.  They have a big investment in gold but they are well aware that the world runs on electronics that use large amount of gold.  I will be willing to bet that they are contemplating a move to bitcoin but they are concerned about their large investment in gold bullion.  \n\n* The issue of energy use is complex.  Firstly let's look at the text of the article which tells us that more than 90% of all bitcoins have already been mined.  That tells me that we have reached a point of diminishing returns in bitcoin mining.  I expect that in the future bitcoin mining will become a much lower energy use activity.  Gold mining on the other hand will continue and grow for hundreds of years.  The pollution caused by gold mining is epic.  Gold is frequently [extracted with cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_cyanidation). It poisons rivers and kills people.  The mining industry has pioneered the use of electric vehicles for underground use.  They have to worry about trapped explosive gasses, but the mining industry uses enormous amounts of fossil fuels.  There is no question that mining is a major pollution source.  There is this green chicken that makes speeches on the internet.  He seems to feel that the world is moving to an energy transition that involves using natural gas as a bridge to a fully electric and photovoltaic or nuclear or ...   something future.  He is mostly correct.  What I think he is wrong about is the speed that this transition is taking.  It will all be over in 15 years.  The natural gas powered truck will come and go so fast you won't even see it.   Finally, it is important to remember that the big AI companies are building nuclear power plants right now. Let's just keep this in perspective.   \n\nI have more thoughts.  Let me know what you think.  \n\n",

        "text": "Hot on the heels of the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) recent resumption of official gold purchases (after a six-month pause), and amid ongoing economic turmoil domestically and trade-war threats geopolitically, Beijing has launched a pilot program  that allows insurers to buy gold for the first time could free up billions of dollars of investment in the metal, adding further impetus to a record-setting rally, hitting a new high (in USD) above $2900 this morning...\n\n\n\nAs Bloomberg reports, ten insurance firms - including PICC Property & Casualty Co. and China Life Insurance Co., two of China’s biggest - will be able to invest as much as 1% of their assets in bullion, in a program that became effective last Friday. \n\nThat would translate into a potential 200 billion yuan ($27.4 billion) of funds, Minsheng Securities Co. said in a note.\n\nThe shift in policy in China could be a signal that authorities recognize the dearth of investment options in Asia’s largest economy, and the need for alternatives amid a property downturn and an economic slump.\n\n“Insurance companies lack options for mid- and long-term assets with stable yields,” Guotai Junan Securities analysts led by Liu Xinqi said in a note, even though bullion typically doesn’t offer that.\n\nThe policy tweak makes gold the first commodity that Chinese insurers have been explicitly permitted to invest in. \n\nChina has restricted insurance funds from taking positions in assets without “stable cash returns,” and limits the amount they can put into bonds and stocks.\n\nAs Jesse Colombo concluded earlier, all signs point to the potential for another explosive gold rally driven by Chinese demand, much like what unfolded last spring. With SHFE gold futures breaking out, the possibility of rising trading volumes, and the return of a Chinese gold price premium, the conditions for another bullish episode are falling into place. China’s economic crisis, record-low bond yields, and the looming prospect of massive stimulus only strengthen the case for gold’s continued ascent. Meanwhile, the PBOC’s renewed gold purchases, alongside this new insurance-gold-purchasing pilot program reinforce the broader shift toward gold as a preferred asset\n\nIf these factors align as expected, the next phase of this bull market could be even more dramatic than what we saw in 2024.From zero hedge.",

        "text": "Hi everybody! Just looking for some insight on a subject I couldn’t find many recent threads on.\n\nMy partner and I are in the process of starting a brick and mortar “cash for gold” business in the heart of downtown of a 2.5M population American city who’s main industry is tourism. We’ve applied for all the necessary licenses and permits, have sufficient liquid assets to bankroll our startup, have purchased a portable XRF machine (Thermo Fisher Niton XL2), own the property and office space outright where our business will be located, etc.\n\nWhat is the viability of this type of business in 2025? From what little I’ve read on this, I know that marketing is probably the biggest factor in terms of who is successful and who is not. We plan on heavily marketing the business online using pay-per-click ad campaigns. We’ve designed our location to be very competitive as far as attracting customers. For example: our central downtown location will be built into an existing Criminal Defense law firm. 95% of that firm’s clients pay cash up front to retain representation for their legal matters. The idea is to offer the gold buying service as a financing option to clients who might otherwise have to obtain money from their friends or family in order to hire an attorney.\n\nAs I said earlier, we will also be investing in other marketing options to reach potential new clients, especially (if not exclusively) online.\n\nAs far as security is concerned, we are taking a small private office located inside the law firm and converting it to be a secure space complete with bulletproof wall panels, a walk-up “bank teller” style window with adequate ballistic glass for handling all transactions, and a controlled entry ballistic grade door. Cameras are already installed at various positions throughout the entire law office building and additional cameras will be installed to cover the secure office space where the gold/cash transactions will occur. Inside the 12x10 foot secure room will be the XRF machine, a computer and printer, a large safe, scales, etc. Also of major note is the fact that two, armed security guards patrol the law building during business hours and, once we open for business, one of the guards’ duties will be tailored to patrol and oversee primarily the law office’s reception area and the controlled access hallway leading up to the bank-style teller window and C4G office door. Keep in mind that there are about 100 law office personnel working in offices within the same building as the cash for gold office.\n\nWhat am I missing? Any advice as to equipment, additional security measures, marketing?\n\nThere are two competing cash for gold locations within 1-2 blocks of us. One is a pawnshop.\n\nThanks in advance for your attention and advice!",

        "text": "Ongoing Gold & Silver Short Squeeze Continues\nFebruary 6 (King World News) – James Turk:  The new year has opened with a bang, Eric, and I expect the good news for gold and silver bulls to continue — provided you own physical metal, which means we need to discuss this ongoing squeeze of short positions in gold and silver that is receiving a lot of media attention. \n\nTariffs are being bandied about as the cause, but I think there is more to it because it is not logical or profitable to delay delivery on short positions.\n\nDecades ago when I first started trading futures, deliveries by the shorts were made on or near what is called First Notice Day. It is always advantageous for the shorts to deliver as soon as possible, but they have to wait for FND. These dates are announced by Comex years in advance.\n\nThe shorts want to deliver because they want to get rid of the metal they sold in advance through futures or forwards and get paid for the metal they are selling. Those dollars they receive from the sale/delivery could then be spent or invested to earn interest, so there is no reason to hold off on meeting their delivery obligation. \n\nAlso, once the metal is delivered, the buyer now pays the metal’s storage. That cost savings is another advantage for the shorts to deliver as soon as possible on or immediately after FND. And that’s the way it works in normal markets. \n\nSo the delays to deliver physical metal – which news reports are saying is several weeks – is not normal. But it is not tariffs that are causing these distortions in my view. \n\nIt’s happening because there are vastly more promises to deliver gold than there is physical metal available at current prices, and maybe even more promises than there is existent gold. The same is true for silver. \n\nConsider this comment in London’s Financial Times. The flow physical of physical metal out of London to New York:\n\n“is causing disruption to the gold market, and has increased the cost of borrowing gold.”\n\nLet’s unpack this sentence. If you are short gold and need to deliver, you must deliver. If you don’t, you default, which could put you or your business if you are a dealer into bankruptcy. That’s what happened to Volume Investors back in 1985, but its collapse was an isolated event with limited knock-on affect.\n\nVolume Investors failed to deliver cash on a margin call, but dollars can be easily borrowed if you are creditworthy (Volume Investors wasn’t). Banks create dollars when they make a loan, but banks cannot conjure up physical gold and silver. So metals have to be borrowed from existent stock, and the shorts are discovering that physical metal is being held by strong hands unwilling to lend their gold – even at these abnormally high interest rates – because they don’t want to take the risk of dealer defaults and never seeing their gold again.\n\nBut there is also another type of strong hands. It is the holders of physical metal unwilling to sell at current prices because they expect prices to rise much further. It’s the same thing that happened in the 1930s. People moved their purchasing power (money) out of banks into paper currency initially, and then as those promises became doubted, out of dollars into gold. The fractional reserve system of more gold promises than existent physical metal is contracting. \n\nSo the shorts have a serious problem, Eric, that is apparent in this gold chart. \n\nKing World News note: The lack of available physical gold has kept pullbacks in the gold market very shallow, despite the blistering upside move from $1,800 to $2,900\n\n\n\nGold had been stair-stepping higher throughout 2024 until a brief shakeout in November. That drop was probably engineered by the shorts because they knew what was coming. So they were no doubt hoping to pick up some physical metal before getting squeezed, which began in earnest during December deliveries.\n\nThat month the shorts – namely the dealers – discovered that it was a hard sell to convince buyers to roll their position into some London paper gold scheme, even when offered enticing rates. Since December the squeeze on shorts has tightened, and as the chart shows, gold is rocketing higher.Written by James Turk.",

Members contribute a fixed monthly amount, and at maturity, they can redeem gold in the form of jewelry, bars, or coins. This structured savings plan makes gold investment accessible to the general public.\n\nI’m curious—does your country offer a similar system where people can gradually save gold instead of money?

I could use my money for income producing assets which long term can help me buy more gold in the future. I am also thinking that if some of the wars end (or others that hopefully don’t get started) that can help decrease the price to more reasonable levels. \n\nAlso people are turning to Cryptos instead of gold which may impact the price of gold as well. I see it continuing to go up for the remainder or the year but I think there has to be a certain correction at some point. \n\nWhat’s everyone else’s opinion? You think gold is too high?

Are there any blind spots in my analysis?\n\nAlso, since products from Canada exported into the United States incurs a tarrifs, could the gold and silver from Canada be devalued compared to the gold and silver in the US?

        "text": "If you’ve spent any time in the world of gold and silver, you’ve probably noticed there are *distinct* personalities in this space. Whether you’re at a coin shop, a Reddit thread, or a gold convention, chances are you’ve run into all four of these types:\n\n# 🪙 Type 1: The Sound Money Purist (a.k.a. “Gold is Real Money” Guy)\n\nThese folks don’t just stack gold—they *preach* it. To them, **gold and silver are the only real money**. Everything else? Fake. Fiat currency? A scam. The Federal Reserve? A Ponzi scheme. Their dream? **Bringing back the gold standard and watching fiat burn.** They likely own a copy of *The Creature from Jekyll Island*, have strong opinions on central banking, and believe that every economic collapse is just one step closer to their “I told you so” moment.\n\n# 💰 Type 2: The Hardcore Stacker (“Premiums? I’d Rather Die”)\n\nFor this person, **gold is wealth preservation**, plain and simple. They’re here to **protect their purchasing power**, not start a revolution. They’re laser-focused on **weight, spot price, and premiums**—and if you overpaid by even a few bucks, trust me, they’ll let you know. To them, **gold is gold**—doesn’t matter if it’s a Maple Leaf, a Krugerrand, or a scratched-up bar with bite marks from the last guy who tested it. If it’s the cheapest per ounce, it’s **good enough**.\n\n# 🧐 Type 3: The Numismatist (“Yes, But Is It Rare?”)\n\nThey’re not just stacking metal—they’re **hunting treasure**. This person loves the thrill of **finding rare coins, limited mintages, and historical pieces**. They’ll gladly pay **10x spot price** if it means securing a **low-population MS-70 from a forgotten 19th-century mint**. They obsess over coin grading, mint errors, and market trends, and while you’re hoarding bullion, they’re out here flipping **high-premium rarities** for insane profits—or holding onto them as *future* grail pieces.\n\n# ✨ Type 4: The Gold Aestheticist (“It’s Just Beautiful, Okay?”)\n\nSome people stack gold for its monetary value—these people stack it because **it’s stunning**. They don’t care about premiums, numismatics, or economic theories. They just love **gold**—the weight, the shine, the sheer beauty of it. Maybe they collect jewelry, maybe they just like to admire their coins under perfect lighting. Either way, their stack isn’t just an investment, it’s a **work of art**.\n\n**So, which one are you?** Or are you a mix of a few? No matter where you fall, we’re all here for the love of gold—whether it’s for wealth, history, security, or just pure admiration. **Drop a comment and tell us your type!** 🏆💰✨",

        "text": "Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the topic of gold revaluation is also ripping through the precious metal pundit circles at a galvanic pace, and for good reason.\n\nBased upon “reported” U.S. gold holdings, if gold were politically re-priced to just $4000 per ounce, that would create an additional $1.2T of instant liquidity (i.e. inflationary M2), which the Treasury Department could then direct deposit into an ever-drying TGA.\n\n(This direct deposit is made legal under Section 2.10 of the Financial Accounting Manual for Federal Reserve Banks.)\n\nSuch a gold revaluation policy would take a lot of pressure off Bessent’s Treasury Department and buy the U.S. more time and money for the aforementioned Trump policies to “Make America Great Again.”\n\nBut could a potential series of gold revaluations to inject new money into the TGA piggy bank truly make America, well… great?\n\nOr would it just save the U.S. economy from crumbling to the ground?\n\nKissinger’s Ghost\nIn the 1970s, Kissinger was very concerned when Europe, which collectively owned more gold than the U.S., wanted to revalue their gold to similarly cover their own debt disasters at home.\n\nThis would mean the U.S. would have to do the same, thereby playing its last Trump card (pun intended) of desperation (reverting to its gold vaults) in 1974.\n\nAnd why was Kissinger so terrified of having to resort to the ultimate “red button” act of desperation in the form of revaluing its last real form of sound money/wealth?\n\nBecause Kissinger knew then what many of us know.\n\nThat is, if the USA shows its hand and starts revaluing gold to higher and higher levels to pay down higher and higher levels of debt (to keep politicians in power and the masses free of pitchforks), this would mean the end of American supremacy, hegemony and/or the Pax Americana.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause he who has the most gold wins, and despite what the World Gold Council reports, it’s an open secret that America does not have the most gold (in a world of central banks stacking gold at record levels and COMEX revolving doors).\n\n\n\nThe Dilemma: Greatness or Survival?\nTrump, Bessent, and the USA itself thus face a debt trap and, hence, a sovereign dilemma of historical import.\n\nYes, certainly, the U.S. can and may revalue its gold holdings to dig itself partially out of debt and hence spur more growth.\n\nBut once/if the U.S. revalues, the rest of the world will naturally follow, and that will make the US just one more economically average nation among many, but certainly not the strongest anymore.\n\nKissinger knew this.\n\nDo Bessent and Trump?\n\nEither Way, Gold Wins\nRegardless of whether such a formal gold revaluation occurs from the top down in DC, the gold price will continue to rise (re-value itself) naturally from the bottom up for the simple reason that debt-soaked nations = debased currencies.\n\nGold, which only rises because fiat money inevitably suffocates under debt, sits at a different kind of historical moment.\n\nIt gets the last laugh because sovereign debt, led by sovereign mismanagement, has killed its sovereign currency in a death by a thousand cuts.\n\nSo, yes, gold gets the last laugh – but the circumstances couldn’t be sadder.by Zerohedge.",

        "text": "This year has started off with a golden hue. Gold and silver have been among the best-performing asset classes in 2025, up 12 percent and 14 percent, respectively, year-to-date. Over the past two months, these precious metals have outperformed bitcoin, which was the best performing asset in 2024, and equity markets around the world. Gold looks positioned to easily top $3,000 in coming weeks, with silver similarly hitting all-time highs.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons to believe that gold prices have further to run from here. Some of the biggest factors supporting a higher gold price include the ongoing accumulation of gold by central banks, persistent inflation, and a global supply shortage of physical gold.\n\nCentral banks, which hold as much as 20 percent of total global gold reserves, are key to the long-term growth in demand for the metal. In recent years, central banks around the world have been accumulating substantial quantities of gold. Net central bank acquisitions of gold topped 1,045 metric tons in 2024, marking the third year in a row of purchases above 1,000 metric tons. These figures reflect the publicly disclosed amounts; many observers believe that China and other countries are secretly acquiring gold well in excess of reported volumes. Most of the buying has come from outside of the United States and Western Europe. The four largest sovereign holders, the United States, Germany, France, and Italy, have been the exception to the gold rush led by the BRICS and other developing nations, and have not acquired additional reserve.By The Epoch Times.",

        "text": "Investment markets are speculating that the U.S. government will revalue its gold holdings, still held on the books at a historical cost of just over $42 per ounce, to the current market value of nearly $3,000. This would instantly plug a portion (potentially nearly $1 trillion) of the gaping hole in the nation’s balance sheet. President Trump has committed to auditing the U.S. government’s gold stockpile, officially on the books at 8,133 metric tons, for the first time in half a century. A successful physical audit would boost confidence in the financial position of the United States, while a shortfall would shock global financial markets and further denigrate the credibility of not just the United States but governments around the world.by Zerohedge.",

        "text": "There is a shortage of physical gold. The London Bullion Market Association is the center of gold trading around the world. Many nations have historically held their gold reserves with the Bank of England, but in recent years have been repatriating their holdings. This has disrupted the London markets and put pressure on prices.\n\nIn recent weeks, demand for delivery of physical gold has skyrocketed. Geopolitical concerns have led to a massive movement of physical gold out of the UK and Europe into vaults in New York and elsewhere. This has led to shortages and speculation of price manipulation. European markets have been spooked by President Trump’s saber-rattling over tariffs, and price differentials have opened up between gold markets across the Atlantic, accelerating the movement of bullion into the United States.\n\nThis spike in demand for physical gold, and resulting logistical bottlenecks, are not only pressuring gold prices but potentially creating a demand spiral. Analogous to a deposit run on a bank, gold customers concerned about the security of their holdings may accelerate demands to withdraw them. This could further squeeze physical supply and quickly boost prices. Many gold derivative contracts are linked to underlying physical collateral. If this collateral can’t be secured, the contracts can fail. This is one reason why holding physical gold is vastly superior to exchange-traded funds or other investment contracts that can’t guarantee delivery of the collateral on demand.\n\nSome gold industry observers have argued that there is evidence that the handful of large banks that issue most of the gold derivatives contracts have acted in concert to manipulate the price of gold. An illegal pricing cartel among the banks would not be unprecedented. The public discovered similar practices in the mortgage securities fraud leading up to the global financial crisis and in the manipulation of LIBOR (the interest rate at which banks lend to one another) uncovered a few years later.\n\nThe recent sharp rise in gold prices may put pressure on these banks and lead to instability in any price fixing arrangement. If the cartel unwinds, it could come quickly and violently. There would be winners and losers, and potential contagion into other markets. In other words, gold derivatives may become the epicenter of the next financial crisis. In such an event, demand for physical gold would spike further, as would prices.\n\nViews expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times or ZeroHedge.\n\n",

        "title": "The Fall of the German Mark and What It Means for the U.S. Dollar Today",
        "text": "This is a follow-up to my earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/1iv0pes/fort_knox_gold_audit_whats_the_real_play_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), where I was talking about the intent of opening up Fort Knox - was it really what was showcased as an audit of gold or just a smoke screen? A fellow redditor had made a point, which was a strong case for me to further research situations where a currency collapses – what happens to lenders (in current case, holders of TBills), everyday citizens and what not. So, I went to look for the case with Germany.\n\n  \n**Germany’s Currency Before WWI: A Strong and Stable Mark**\n\nBefore World War I, the German mark was one of the strongest currencies in the world. Germany was a rising industrial and economic power, competing directly with Britain and the United States. The Reichsmark was backed by gold, and its value remained stable due to prudent fiscal policies and Germany’s growing export economy.\n\nAt the time, 1 gold-backed German mark was roughly equivalent to $0.25 USD, which was a significant amount of purchasing power. Germany had a strong banking system, and its trade surplus helped maintain confidence in the currency. But World War I changed everything.\n\n**The Currency Collapse Between WWI and WWII**\n\nWhen Germany entered WWI (1914-1918), the government suspended the gold standard to finance the war. Instead of taxing its citizens, Germany printed massive amounts of paper money, assuming that it would win the war and repay its debts using reparations from defeated nations. What happened next? Germany lost the war and was forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which imposed 132 billion gold marks in reparations. The German government kept printing money to pay for war debts and reparations instead of finding sustainable revenue sources. By 1923, hyperinflation had completely destroyed the mark—at its peak, prices doubled every few hours.\n\nTo put it in perspective, in 1914, 1 USD was equal to 4 German marks but in 1923, 1 USD was at 4.2 trillion marks\n\nThis meant that workers were paid multiple times a day because their wages lost value within hours. People burned money for heat because it was cheaper than firewood. This economic catastrophe destroyed the German middle class and created deep resentment, laying the groundwork for the rise of Adolf Hitler.\n\n **Stabilization: The Dawes Plan, Young Plan & the Rise of Hitler**\n\nAfter hyperinflation, Germany introduced a new currency—the Rentenmark (1924)—which was backed by land and industrial goods instead of gold. The Dawes Plan (1924), funded mostly by U.S. banks, helped stabilize the economy by reducing reparation payments and injecting loans into German industry. Germany received an initial loan of 800 million marks, mostly from U.S. banks (e.g., J.P. Morgan & Co.). These loans helped stabilize Germany’s economy, rebuild infrastructure, and support industry. The German central bank (Reichsbank) was placed under international supervision to ensure financial discipline.\n\nBy 1929, the Young Plan further restructured German debt, but then came the Great Depression. The U.S. stock market crashed, cutting off financial support to Germany. Unemployment skyrocketed, and desperation led people to embrace radical political change—this was when Hitler gained momentum. Unlike the Dawes Plan, the Young Plan removed international control over the Reichsbank and German economy. By 1931, Germany was unable to continue payments, and international banks suffered losses. In 1932, the Lausanne Conference officially canceled most of Germany’s remaining reparations.\n\nBy 1933, Hitler completely abandoned all reparation payments, introduced the Reichsmark, and pushed Germany into military expansion, setting the stage for World War II.\n\n**The Role of Gold in Germany’s Economic Collapse**\n\nGold played an interesting role in this entire saga. Before WWI, the mark was backed by gold, ensuring stability. During WWI, Germany abandoned the gold standard, leading to reckless money printing. After hyperinflation, the new currency had to be backed by tangible assets (land & industry) instead of gold because the reserves were too depleted. When Hitler came to power, Germany began hoarding gold again, acquiring it through trade manipulation, looting, and war conquests. In short, the presence (or absence) of gold determined the fate of the German economy at every major turning point.\n\n**Parallels to the U.S. Dollar Today**\n\nFast forward to today, and we’re seeing some eerie similarities between the German mark’s downfall and the current state of the U.S. dollar.\n\nMassive Debt & Deficits - The U.S. national debt is now over $34 trillion, with annual deficits exceeding $2 trillion. The U.S. government relies on printing money and borrowing, similar to Germany post-WWI.\n\nRising Interest Payments - The U.S. now spends more on interest payments than on defense or Medicare. As interest rates rise, debt compounds faster, making repayment nearly impossible.\n\nForeign Holders of U.S. Debt - China, Japan, and other nations hold trillions in U.S. Treasury bonds. If they lose confidence in the dollar and start selling off debt, the U.S. could face a crisis similar to Germany’s post-WWI foreign debt crisis.\n\nDe-Dollarization - Many countries, including China, Russia, and BRICS nations, are moving away from the U.S. dollar for trade. If global confidence in the dollar collapses, hyperinflation is a real possibility, just like Germany in 1923.\n\nThe Role of Gold - Unlike in 1971 (when Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard), central banks today are hoarding gold at record levels. Countries like China, India and Russia are aggressively buying gold, preparing for a post-dollar world. If the dollar collapses, gold will once again be the ultimate store of value, just like it was during the German crises.\n\n**So, What Happens If the U.S. Dollar Collapses?**\n\nIf history repeats itself, the U.S. could face a stage of hyperinflation, making basic goods unaffordable for the average person. There would be massive economic and political upheaval, leading to radical changes in government policies and we could expect a shift to alternative stores of value, like gold, silver, Bitcoin, or a new international reserve currency. Finally, a potential loss of U.S. global dominance would mean other nations push for a multi-currency world order.\n\n**So what next?**\n\nHistory doesn’t repeat itself exactly, but the patterns are clear. Germany's currency collapse was a warning about the dangers of reckless money printing, excessive debt, and foreign reliance. The U.S. is not immune to these same forces.\n\nThese are my questions for a discussion to fellow redditors: \n\n1. **What do you think would happen to countries that hold US dollars (either as reserve currency or as T-Bills)? Will US default like Germany and finally have its debt cancelled by magic?**\n2. **What happens to our incomes? Does it mean our wages now go up in numbers (though not in value)?**\n3. **Finally, when Gold becomes a standard again, do you anticipate Executive Order 6102 in US to Banking Act of 1959 in Australia to Gold Ban act in 1966 in UK to Gold Control Act in India in 1968 and so on, to restrict private ownership of gold?**",

But gold is what I think of as investment/store of wealth. \n\nAnd as far as jewelry goes, if it isn’t 18k or higher I am not buying it, even if buying a pair of earrings for a lovely lady or gift.

You can’t just walk into most stores and buy groceries or gas with it. Yet, every time it surges, people start calling it \"the future of finance,\" but that future never really happens.\n\nI keep hearing about institutional money coming in, but if it’s mostly hedge funds and whales pushing the price up, how does that make it a real currency? If regular people are just there to provide liquidity for the big dogs, how is this different from a glorified pump-and-dump?\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm a Bitcoin fan and have been buying and selling it for years now. But I cringe everytime I hear “It’s digital gold”.. Gold has a use beyond its speculative value. It can be made into jewelry, art.. People want to have it because its a ‘real’ thing you can hold in your hands! Bitcoin's only real use is making anonymous transactions that regular humans don't usually need to make.\n\nAm I missing something here, or is Bitcoin actually just a bigger fool scheme?\n\nEdit: When you ask the trading AI everyone on tiktok uses ([this one](http://trademind.ca))  It basically says Bitcoin isn’t a Ponzi because there’s no central scammer, no guaranteed payouts, and it still functions even when prices crash. It’s more like a scarce digital asset that people trade, kind of like gold but way more volatile. But that still doesn’t really answer why it hasn’t become a real mainstream currency. Feels like people just trade it hoping someone else will pay more later.",

        "text": "JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (among others) estimate a 30-40% chance of a large S&P 500 decline this year up to 30% with the maximum probable upside of 6-8%.  The Shiller P/E ratio is approaching a 20 year high, it has never been this high without some sort of crash. \n\n\nThe only market conditions that are different is that inflation is down.  \n\n\nYes that's right I said down.  With exception of 1929 and 2020 the top 5 market crashes have been preceded by inflation rates of 3.8 to 6.2%.  2024 was 2.9%.  Current estimates for this year are 2.4-2.9% so it's headed down.  But if it hits 3% I would pay close attention.  The 1929 crash happened after a year of negative inflation.  Passive investing has passed active investing for the first time ever.  Warren Buffet is 50% cash right now.\n\n\nBUT WE'Re NOT WaRREn bUFfet\n\n\nHe's not the only one making that move.  All the popular hedgefunds are a larger percentage cash right now.  Berkshire Hathaway is 33% cash equivalents up from 17% in 2023.  Buffet was only 20% cash in Novemeber the bought the dip, a huge move no one is giving him credit for.  He literally took half his net worth and put it in something that was going down.\n\n\nIf you want something a little riskier but better upside go gold.  It goes up during volatility regardless of the market going up or down.  During a market crash it can go up fast or at worst it still recovers faster than the market.  I would say that any sort of crash would likely jump gold value as people would look to that rather than risking inflation going up more.   Gold price is even more effected by worldwide volatility than USA volatility, a huge driver of it right now is Saudis and other rich familys looking to preserve and grow their generational wealth.  Gold is the new/old ETF it's already diversified into every country and every sector of industry.  ",

The H100’s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia’s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia’s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.\n\nDeepSeek’s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia’s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek’s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia’s high pricing, pressuring the company’s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek’s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.\n\nDespite its strong position, Nvidia’s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta—companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia’s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia’s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia’s stock price.\n\nFor years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia’s “There Is No Alternative” (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia’s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.\n\nThe AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia’s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD’s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek’s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia’s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia’s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nDeepSeek’s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.\n\nNvidia’s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia’s pricing power and long-term growth.

The H100’s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia’s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia’s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.\n\nDeepSeek’s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia’s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek’s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia’s high pricing, pressuring the company’s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek’s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.\n\nDespite its strong position, Nvidia’s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta—companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia’s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia’s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia’s stock price.\n\nFor years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia’s “There Is No Alternative” (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia’s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.\n\nThe AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia’s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD’s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek’s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia’s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia’s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nDeepSeek’s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.\n\nNvidia’s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves.

I'm looking at bonds like LQD and JNK as well as TLT and other shorter treasuries and it seems to me that CDs and money markets pound bonds into the ground.  Why give up FDIC protection and no risk of principal to make less than bonds pay? I see yields of 0.5% a month which is lower than most money markets and bonds.  Maybe I just don't understand bonds but every time I've looked I come away thinking bonds are worthless, and I should put my money into CD ladders and money markets and not any in bonds, whether it is corp junk, corp investment grade, US treasuries, or any type of bond. So I'm considering 10% into Gold (GLD), 40% in CD ladders and the rest in a money market.  I'm 60 years old and given all that is wrong wiith me, I won't be alive in 20 years and 10 years isn't a likely thing either.  The bottom line is how can bonds be better when they pay less dividents than money markets or CDs, no matter what?  I lived in Ecuador and they paid 10% for a 1 year CD of at least $10,000.

        "text": "Hi all, I have managed to save up just under £70k from jobs that I've had since around 19, and I am looking to start investing. I had started investing when i was about 19, and I had put money into crypto and index funds, as well as a few other random things. However, the start of my investing career was around the time of covid, which scared me off and since then any money I've put aside has just been put into high-yield savings accounts (obviously regret this now with how much the S&P500, cyrpto and World indexes have gone up in that time haha). My current planned allocation is below:\n\n\\- 40% in FTSE all world (VWRP)  \n\\- 35% in high yield easy access savings accounts  \n\\-15% in Emerging Markets ETF (VFEG)  \n\\- 5% in individual high growth stocks (personally looking at AI stocks, but not finalised the exact stocks as of yet)  \n\\- 2.5% in gold  \n\\- 2.5% in Bitcoin\n\nI am also unsure if i should just dump everything in at once, or if I should DCA. I am definitely more on the conservative side of risk, and I'm scared if I lost say 10% in the market before the end of the year I'd cash out and then have the same regrets as I did when I cashed out during covid. So my thinking is that if I put in say £10k, and set up auto-investing of £2k for the foreseeable future, I'd be more likely to stick to my investment plan.\n\nIf anyone has any opinions on my portfolio allocation, or any tips on whether I should dump or use DCA, I'd really appreciate it!",

If so how much and what kind?  \n\nOr would you buy puts on the S&P?

I was going to retire at 65 and wasn’t worried about it initially but now over the last 2 years i find myself obsessing over how Meta is doing vs Lamar vs Kinder Morgan, and trying to tax harvest and buy and sell when i can and try to keep up to date… its a god damn full time job.   You guys have good advice that i needed to hear.  I’m going to speak to our financial planner at work, change my 403b to vanguard target that matches my retirement actual retirement date and not when I’m 65, and i found the bogelhead interesting… less stress, less checking up less balancing….  So I’m going to read up on him and his style.   I initially was buffet like meaning 90%-10% but my 90 did not have ETFs… it was single stocks so i have come a down a bit on those and way cutting those back still….

        "text": "JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (among others) estimate a 30-40% chance of a large S&P 500 decline this year up to 30% with the maximum probable upside of 6-8%.  The Shiller P/E ratio is approaching a 20 year high, it has never been this high without some sort of crash. \n\n\nThe only market conditions that are different is that inflation is down.  \n\n\nYes that's right I said down.  With exception of 1929 and 2020 the top 5 market crashes have been preceded by inflation rates of 3.8 to 6.2%.  2024 was 2.9%.  Current estimates for this year are 2.4-2.9% so it's headed down.  But if it hits 3% I would pay close attention.  The 1929 crash happened after a year of negative inflation.  Passive investing has passed active investing for the first time ever.  Warren Buffet is 50% cash right now.\n\n\nBUT WE'Re NOT WaRREn bUFfet\n\n\nHe's not the only one making that move.  All the popular hedgefunds are a larger percentage cash right now.  Berkshire Hathaway is 33% cash equivalents up from 17% in 2023.  Buffet was only 20% cash in Novemeber the bought the dip, a huge move no one is giving him credit for.  He literally took half his net worth and put it in something that was going down.\n\n\nIf you want something a little riskier but better upside go gold.  It goes up during volatility regardless of the market going up or down.  During a market crash it can go up fast or at worst it still recovers faster than the market.  I would say that any sort of crash would likely jump gold value as people would look to that rather than risking inflation going up more.   Gold price is even more effected by worldwide volatility than USA volatility, a huge driver of it right now is Saudis and other rich familys looking to preserve and grow their generational wealth.  Gold is the new/old ETF it's already diversified into every country and every sector of industry.  ",

        "text": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates and a prominent investor, has frequently emphasized the importance of holding gold as part of a diversified investment portfolio. His preference for gold is rooted in several key factors tied to his broader economic philosophy.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dalio views gold as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. He often highlights that governments tend to print money during economic crises, which diminishes the purchasing power of traditional currencies. Gold, being a finite resource with intrinsic value, retains its purchasing power and often appreciates during periods of inflation.\n\nAdditionally, Dalio believes that gold serves as a reliable store of value during geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Unlike stocks or bonds, gold is not tied to any single government or corporation, making it a safer asset during turbulent times. He has pointed out that during periods of financial instability, gold often performs well, providing a necessary counterbalance to riskier investments.\n\nAnother factor is Dalio’s emphasis on risk diversification. His investment philosophy, which includes his well-known “All Weather Portfolio,” is centered on maintaining a balance across various asset classes to protect against unpredictable market conditions. Gold plays a crucial role in this strategy because it often moves inversely to equities and other financial assets. Given Dalio’s emphasis on preparing for “what you don’t know,” gold is a logical choice for him. \n\nMy question is how did someone like Dalio invest in gold? Given his wealth, it has to be some gold backed financial instrument in my mind.",

However, Nvidia’s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.\n\n  \nShifting Market Perception – The narrative is changing from “AI success = Nvidia success” to a more fragmented AI ecosystem where efficiency, affordability, and alternative suppliers are gaining traction.\n\n* Financial and Competitive Pressures – Nvidia depends heavily on a few major tech companies, faces emerging competition from AMD, Broadcom, and DeepSeek, and has a valuation significantly above industry norms, making it vulnerable to market corrections.\n* Shifting Market Perception – The narrative is changing from “AI success = Nvidia success” to a more fragmented AI ecosystem where efficiency, affordability, and alternative suppliers are gaining traction.\n\nNvidia has established itself as a dominant force in the AI hardware industry, with its H100 and H800 chips powering some of the most advanced AI models, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The H100’s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia’s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia’s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.\n\nDeepSeek’s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia’s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek’s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia’s high pricing, pressuring the company’s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek’s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.\n\nDespite its strong position, Nvidia’s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta—companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia’s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia’s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia’s stock price.\n\nFor years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia’s “There Is No Alternative” (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia’s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.\n\nThe AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia’s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD’s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek’s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia’s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia’s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nDeepSeek’s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.\n\nNvidia’s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia’s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia’s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.\n\nIf the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.\n\n# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek’s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia’s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia’s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.",

I had started investing when i was about 19, and I had put money into crypto and index funds, as well as a few other random things. However, the start of my investing career was around the time of covid, which scared me off and since then any money I've put aside has just been put into high-yield savings accounts (obviously regret this now with how much the S&P500, cyrpto and World indexes have gone up in that time haha). My current planned allocation is below:\n\n\\- 40% in FTSE all world (VWRP)  \n\\- 35% in high yield easy access savings accounts  \n\\-15% in Emerging Markets ETF (VFEG)  \n\\- 5% in individual high growth stocks (personally looking at AI stocks, but not finalised the exact stocks as of yet)  \n\\- 2.5% in gold  \n\\- 2.5% in Bitcoin\n\nI am also unsure if i should just dump everything in at once, or if I should DCA. I am definitely more on the conservative side of risk, and I'm scared if I lost say 10% in the market before the end of the year I'd cash out and then have the same regrets as I did when I cashed out during covid. So my thinking is that if I put in say £10k, and set up auto-investing of £2k for the foreseeable future, I'd be more likely to stick to my investment plan.\n\nIf anyone has any opinions on my portfolio allocation, or any tips on whether I should dump or use DCA, I'd really appreciate it!",

The Shiller P/E ratio is approaching a 20 year high, it has never been this high without some sort of crash. \n\n\nThe only market conditions that are different is that inflation is down.  \n\n\nYes that's right I said down.  With exception of 1929 and 2020 the top 5 market crashes have been preceded by inflation rates of 3.8 to 6.2%.  2024 was 2.9%.  Current estimates for this year are 2.4-2.9% so it's headed down.  But if it hits 3% I would pay close attention.  The 1929 crash happened after a year of negative inflation.  Passive investing has passed active investing for the first time ever.  Warren Buffet is 50% cash right now.\n\n\nBUT WE'Re NOT WaRREn bUFfet\n\n\nHe's not the only one making that move.  All the popular hedgefunds are a larger percentage cash right now.  Berkshire Hathaway is 33% cash equivalents up from 17% in 2023.  Buffet was only 20% cash in Novemeber the bought the dip, a huge move no one is giving him credit for.  He literally took half his net worth and put it in something that was going down.\n\n\nIf you want something a little riskier but better upside go gold.  It goes up during volatility regardless of the market going up or down.  During a market crash it can go up fast or at worst it still recovers faster than the market.  I would say that any sort of crash would likely jump gold value as people would look to that rather than risking inflation going up more.   Gold price is even more effected by worldwide volatility than USA volatility, a huge driver of it right now is Saudis and other rich familys looking to preserve and grow their generational wealth.

        "text": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates and a prominent investor, has frequently emphasized the importance of holding gold as part of a diversified investment portfolio. His preference for gold is rooted in several key factors tied to his broader economic philosophy.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dalio views gold as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. He often highlights that governments tend to print money during economic crises, which diminishes the purchasing power of traditional currencies. Gold, being a finite resource with intrinsic value, retains its purchasing power and often appreciates during periods of inflation.\n\nAdditionally, Dalio believes that gold serves as a reliable store of value during geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Unlike stocks or bonds, gold is not tied to any single government or corporation, making it a safer asset during turbulent times. He has pointed out that during periods of financial instability, gold often performs well, providing a necessary counterbalance to riskier investments.\n\nAnother factor is Dalio’s emphasis on risk diversification. His investment philosophy, which includes his well-known “All Weather Portfolio,” is centered on maintaining a balance across various asset classes to protect against unpredictable market conditions. Gold plays a crucial role in this strategy because it often moves inversely to equities and other financial assets. Given Dalio’s emphasis on preparing for “what you don’t know,” gold is a logical choice for him. \n\nMy question is how did someone like Dalio invest in gold? Given his wealth, it has to be some gold backed financial instrument in my mind.",

        "title": "Bitcoin: A Waste of Value, Not a Store of Value",
        "text": "Let’s begin with a simple thought experiment. Take two sticky notes. On one, write the number \"1.\" On the other, write \"1000.\" Now ask yourself: Does the second note store 1000 times more value than the first? Of course not. That would be absurd. Why? Because numeric labels do not provide future benefits. Storing value means having the potential to provide benefits in the future.\n\nTake stocks, for example. Holding 1000 shares instead of one isn’t just holding a bigger number, as in the sticky note example. It translates into real benefits. If the company distributes profits, 1000 shares yield 1000 times more dividends. If the company liquidates, 1000 shares result in 1000 times more payout from remaining assets. In this case, the numbers represent equity, and from that equity comes the potential for future benefits in the form of dividends or payouts.\n\nNow, consider U.S. dollars. What do the numbers on them represent? The answer lies in their creation, which happens in two ways. First, the government sells bonds, and the Federal Reserve buys them with newly created dollars. Second, banks issue loans to individuals or businesses, creating new dollars in the process.\n\nIn both cases, the numbers represent debt. Holding $1000 instead of $1 isn’t just holding a bigger number. It means having the potential to reduce 1000 times more debt, which is a tangible benefit. If a business owes a bank, your dollars can reduce that debt. If the government owes the Federal Reserve, your dollars can help erase that liability. If an individual has a mortgage, your dollars can help release them from that obligation. Dollars store value because they can extinguish the debt that created them, providing real benefits to debtors in the U.S. banking system.\n\nConsider warehouse receipts for wheat. If you hold a certificate for 1000 bushels, you have 1000 times more potential to feed people than if you hold a certificate for just one bushel. These numbers are not just empty labels. They represent stored value with real future benefits.\n\nGold certificates work the same way. A certificate for 1000 ounces of gold has 1000 times more value than one for a single ounce. These certificates represent physical gold, a metal whose unique properties provide tangible benefits.\n\nNow consider Bitcoin. Unlike stocks, dollars, wheat, or gold certificates, Bitcoin doesn’t represent anything that provides future benefits. Owning 1000 Bitcoins instead of 1 doesn’t mean 1000 times more dividends, payouts, debt settlement, or physical benefits like food or metal. It only means that more electricity was consumed to mine them.\n\nThat is the critical flaw. Bitcoin is essentially a digital version of the numbers on those sticky notes. It represents only the energy spent to create it, a value that has already been used up. Unlike money, whether debt-based or commodity-based, which stores value for future benefit, Bitcoin is simply a numeric token of wasted energy.\n\nBitcoin mining burns electricity, but that energy isn’t transformed into a resource capable of providing future benefits. It is simply wasted. Compare this to gold mining. Although it also consumes energy, the resulting product has real utility in electronics, jewelry, and various other applications. With Bitcoin mining, however, nothing is left behind except numbers assigned to addresses.\n\nThe entire Bitcoin craze is based on the illusion of trading money that stores value. In reality, what is traded are tokens of value already spent. It is like swapping used lottery tickets and believing the jackpot is still up for grabs.\n\nNo matter how many times you trade such tickets, they will always represent only a record of past consumption, not a claim on future value. Similarly, securing Bitcoin tokens on the most advanced blockchain networks, limiting their supply, or adopting them at an institutional level cannot magically tie them to a resource that offers future benefits. They will always represent only energy spent in the past.\n\nMoney, assets, and commodities represent value stored for future benefit. Bitcoin represents value wasted in the past. That is why it is none of the above. At best, it is a speculative game. At worst, it is the dumbest thing ever created.",

        "text": "My portfolio is at the point where I’m looking to lean more toward stability than maximizing growth. I figure these tariffs are probably as good a reason as any to start implementing a more conservative strategy.\n\nPrevious strategy: max out 401k dumping everything into S&P 500 index funds with low fees, then whatever excess I had in taxable I’d stick the vast majority into VOO, then a little into QQQ, random stocks, gold, and/or crypto (mostly BTC, a little ETH). \n\nPretty much have done this with every paycheck for the last decade or so. Has worked out. But as I approach retirement I want to transition to increased stability, less aggressive gains. And I don’t get the impression we have a particularly economically beneficial administration on our hands at the moment. So it’s time to pivot, for a number of reasons.\n\nI know the traditional playbook is to weight your portfolio away from stocks and toward bonds, but I’ve never bought bonds before and don’t know where to start.\n\nDo bonds have a better yield than 4.5% or should I just stick with hoarding cash in a HYSA? Should I be considering CDs or anything else? Is there another strategy you’re implementing, if you’re in a similar situation?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

        "text": "Genuinely asking, not here to troll. Bitcoin has been popular for 15 years, but it still doesn’t seem to have a mainstream, everyday use. You can’t just walk into most stores and buy groceries or gas with it. Yet, every time it surges, people start calling it \"the future of finance,\" but that future never really happens.\n\nI keep hearing about institutional money coming in, but if it’s mostly hedge funds and whales pushing the price up, how does that make it a real currency? If regular people are just there to provide liquidity for the big dogs, how is this different from a glorified pump-and-dump?\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm a Bitcoin fan and have been buying and selling it for years now. But I cringe everytime I hear “It’s digital gold”.. Gold has a use beyond its speculative value. It can be made into jewelry, art.. People want to have it because its a ‘real’ thing you can hold in your hands! Bitcoin's only real use is making anonymous transactions that regular humans don't usually need to make.\n\nAm I missing something here, or is Bitcoin actually just a bigger fool scheme?\n\nEdit: When you ask the trading AI everyone on tiktok uses ([this one](http://trademind.ca))  It basically says Bitcoin isn’t a Ponzi because there’s no central scammer, no guaranteed payouts, and it still functions even when prices crash. It’s more like a scarce digital asset that people trade, kind of like gold but way more volatile. But that still doesn’t really answer why it hasn’t become a real mainstream currency. Feels like people just trade it hoping someone else will pay more later.",

I'm looking at bonds like LQD and JNK as well as TLT and other shorter treasuries and it seems to me that CDs and money markets pound bonds into the ground.  Why give up FDIC protection and no risk of principal to make less than bonds pay? I see yields of 0.5% a month which is lower than most money markets and bonds.  Maybe I just don't understand bonds but every time I've looked I come away thinking bonds are worthless, and I should put my money into CD ladders and money markets and not any in bonds, whether it is corp junk, corp investment grade, US treasuries, or any type of bond.

I had started investing when i was about 19, and I had put money into crypto and index funds, as well as a few other random things. However, the start of my investing career was around the time of covid, which scared me off and since then any money I've put aside has just been put into high-yield savings accounts (obviously regret this now with how much the S&P500, cyrpto and World indexes have gone up in that time haha). My current planned allocation is below:\n\n\\- 40% in FTSE all world (VWRP)  \n\\- 35% in high yield easy access savings accounts  \n\\-15% in Emerging Markets ETF (VFEG)  \n\\- 5% in individual high growth stocks (personally looking at AI stocks, but not finalised the exact stocks as of yet)  \n\\- 2.5% in gold  \n\\- 2.5% in Bitcoin\n\nI am also unsure if i should just dump everything in at once, or if I should DCA. I am definitely more on the conservative side of risk, and I'm scared if I lost say 10% in the market before the end of the year I'd cash out and then have the same regrets as I did when I cashed out during covid. So my thinking is that if I put in say £10k, and set up auto-investing of £2k for the foreseeable future, I'd be more likely to stick to my investment plan.\n\nIf anyone has any opinions on my portfolio allocation, or any tips on whether I should dump or use DCA, I'd really appreciate it!",

The Shiller P/E ratio is approaching a 20 year high, it has never been this high without some sort of crash. \n\n\nThe only market conditions that are different is that inflation is down.  \n\n\nYes that's right I said down.  With exception of 1929 and 2020 the top 5 market crashes have been preceded by inflation rates of 3.8 to 6.2%.  2024 was 2.9%.  Current estimates for this year are 2.4-2.9% so it's headed down.  But if it hits 3% I would pay close attention.  The 1929 crash happened after a year of negative inflation.  Passive investing has passed active investing for the first time ever.  Warren Buffet is 50% cash right now.\n\n\nBUT WE'Re NOT WaRREn bUFfet\n\n\nHe's not the only one making that move.  All the popular hedgefunds are a larger percentage cash right now.  Berkshire Hathaway is 33% cash equivalents up from 17% in 2023.  Buffet was only 20% cash in Novemeber the bought the dip, a huge move no one is giving him credit for.  He literally took half his net worth and put it in something that was going down.\n\n\nIf you want something a little riskier but better upside go gold.  It goes up during volatility regardless of the market going up or down.  During a market crash it can go up fast or at worst it still recovers faster than the market.  I would say that any sort of crash would likely jump gold value as people would look to that rather than risking inflation going up more.   Gold price is even more effected by worldwide volatility than USA volatility, a huge driver of it right now is Saudis and other rich familys looking to preserve and grow their generational wealth.  Gold is the new/old ETF it's already diversified into every country and every sector of industry.  ",

        "text": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates and a prominent investor, has frequently emphasized the importance of holding gold as part of a diversified investment portfolio. His preference for gold is rooted in several key factors tied to his broader economic philosophy.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dalio views gold as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. He often highlights that governments tend to print money during economic crises, which diminishes the purchasing power of traditional currencies. Gold, being a finite resource with intrinsic value, retains its purchasing power and often appreciates during periods of inflation.\n\nAdditionally, Dalio believes that gold serves as a reliable store of value during geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Unlike stocks or bonds, gold is not tied to any single government or corporation, making it a safer asset during turbulent times. He has pointed out that during periods of financial instability, gold often performs well, providing a necessary counterbalance to riskier investments.\n\nAnother factor is Dalio’s emphasis on risk diversification. His investment philosophy, which includes his well-known “All Weather Portfolio,” is centered on maintaining a balance across various asset classes to protect against unpredictable market conditions. Gold plays a crucial role in this strategy because it often moves inversely to equities and other financial assets. Given Dalio’s emphasis on preparing for “what you don’t know,” gold is a logical choice for him. \n\nMy question is how did someone like Dalio invest in gold? Given his wealth, it has to be some gold backed financial instrument in my mind.",

The H100’s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia’s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia’s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.\n\nDeepSeek’s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia’s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek’s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia’s high pricing, pressuring the company’s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek’s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.\n\nDespite its strong position, Nvidia’s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta—companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia’s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia’s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia’s stock price.\n\nFor years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia’s “There Is No Alternative” (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia’s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.\n\nThe AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia’s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD’s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek’s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia’s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia’s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nDeepSeek’s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.\n\nNvidia’s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia’s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia’s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.\n\nIf the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.\n\n# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek’s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia’s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia’s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.\n\n  \nShifting Market Perception – The narrative is changing from “AI success = Nvidia success” to a more fragmented AI ecosystem where efficiency, affordability, and alternative suppliers are gaining traction.\n\n* Financial and Competitive Pressures – Nvidia depends heavily on a few major tech companies, faces emerging competition from AMD, Broadcom, and DeepSeek, and has a valuation significantly above industry norms, making it vulnerable to market corrections.\n* Shifting Market Perception – The narrative is changing from “AI success = Nvidia success” to a more fragmented AI ecosystem where efficiency, affordability, and alternative suppliers are gaining traction.\n\nNvidia has established itself as a dominant force in the AI hardware industry, with its H100 and H800 chips powering some of the most advanced AI models, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The H100’s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia’s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia’s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.\n\nDeepSeek’s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia’s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek’s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia’s high pricing, pressuring the company’s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek’s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.\n\nDespite its strong position, Nvidia’s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta—companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia’s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia’s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia’s stock price.\n\nFor years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia’s “There Is No Alternative” (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia’s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.\n\nThe AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia’s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD’s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek’s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia’s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia’s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nDeepSeek’s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.\n\nNvidia’s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia’s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia’s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.\n\nIf the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.\n\n# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek’s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia’s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia’s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.",

        "text": "A few hours ago I saw some regard posting[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/) on the mining industry gassing up regarded metals like lithium and rare earths. I'm going to attempt to explain to you regards why gold and silver mines print money and critical minerals projects are critically regarded.\n\n**Rare Earths**\n\nRare earths are not rare! The main payable metal is NdPr Neodymium Praseodymium used for magnets. With Neodymium prices in the toilet due to China doing China things like injecting ammonium sulfate directly into the ground to leach the rare earths in situ, most hard rock projects like MP materials are losing money.\n\nThere are some great ionic clay rare earth projects out there with over 2% rare earth oxides but they exist on non freedom exchanges like the TSX and the ASX and are development projects that aren't mining anything yet.\n\nThe key issue with rare earths is processing capacity. This will probably get on-shored to the US in the next 5-10 years and China and Lynas Rare Earths will no longer be the only processors. This is why UUUU is the least regarded investment OP listed. DYODD.\n\n**Lithium**\n\nThere was never a shortage of lithium, only a shortage of lithium processing capacity. Any deposit under 1% lithium is not going to be economic. Lithium is about as rare as copper. Guys at Exxon are developing direct lithium extraction technologies to extract lithium directly out of saltwater wells in [Arkansas](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/1113_exxonmobil-drilling-first-lithium-well-in-arkansas).\n\nIf they figure that out most existing hard rock mines may no longer be economical. Lithium is the most regarded bet. Any decent lithium project worth anything got built in the last few years.\n\n**Gold and Silver**\n\nWe are in the beginning of a precious metals bull market. Any regard can see this in the gold chart. Historically silver prices tend to follow gold prices, but silver moons harder than gold does because the average regard is too poor to buy gold.\n\nGold is what central banks buy when their butt holes start to pucker. And they have been buying gold at record levels recently.\n\nGDX and GDXJ are terrible bets because most gold companies are trash. Barrick was producing 5 million ounces 10 years ago now they're down to 2 million ounces. Nemont did so many acquisitions in the past 20 years ballooning its share count offsetting any kind of rise in profits or production they might have experienced. These companies have ruined the reputation of the mining sector for most institutions and retail investors.\n\nIt's best to bet on mid tier producers that are building or developing new mines.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59zhe7f38rke1.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=64554b0001ea145e64283e67a4a58d4b797a290a\n\nEquinox Gold just reported great earnings as their new flagship gold mine in Canada has reached commercial nameplate capacity. While their new mine is printing money they will make the sustaining capital investments in their other mines that they have put off which will lead to even more baggies.",

        "text": "I want to focus a sector that receives no love: Mining.\n\nTrading at decade-lows with little investor interest, mining stocks today are like tech stocks in 2001. I'm going to show you how they have all the elements of a 10-bagger play, and how you should take advantage of the upcoming bull run\n\n**PART 1: Qualities of a 10-Bagger**\n\nWithout overcomplicating things, a 10-bagger stock or industry can be summarized with these elements:\n\n1. Left For Dead Prices - Prices that don't reflect the baked in value or potential growth of the company, especially compared to historic averages, since prices are typically mean-reverting.\n2. Little Investor Participation - Trades that aren't crowded out by investors, muting potential future gains.\n3. Ridiculous Potential - Massive margins of safety and explosive potential upside that lead to companies consistently growing their top line.\n\n**PART 2: A Tale of Two Sectors**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5aslgqpajje1.jpg?width=1341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5045ac70d14bd4b629332bac9984ad0c845b1829\n\nYou've been a regard for investing in mining over the past \\~30 years. The index rose over \\~5x, and you're flat. Any active manager in Mining stocks has either been fired or full-ported into Apple at this point.\n\nIt's even more stark when you compare to tech. Over the past 30 years, the tech sector delivered \\~5,000% return, dwarfing the broader market’s \\~1,874%.\n\nInvestors have crowded the trade, leading to a situation where you nearly can't avoid exposure to the richly valued tech names:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47riv3obbjje1.jpg?width=1389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e31b8099d02c792cbb737a2f9ee17374f99ef163\n\nSafe to say miners aren't included in any meaningful allocation in today's indexes.\n\nBut do they have the potential to 10x from here?\n\n**PART 3: Left for Dead Prices**\n\nThe most compelling case for a 10-bagger is being cheap. Buying Apple at 10-15 PE in the 2010's is retrospectively a no-brainer. It gives you an incredible margin of safety if you're buying growth for value prices.\n\nMiners are cyclical companies deeply exposed to the price of the ores they mine. Whether it's copper, silver, gold, or rare metals, miners generally scale with the price of their underlying commodity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/670ubnytljje1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=685e17313d2d2d33bed2d39c3733183eced31cba\n\nFor gold miners, this hasn't been the case. Despite gold roaring to highs around $2900 an ounce, the average gold miner is down over the past 20 years.\n\nMany of these miners produce gold for less then $1000 an ounce and have been reinvesting their income into future production. Let's take a look under the hood at B2Gold $BTG\n\n|B2Gold|Metrics|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Assets|4,788,737K|\n|Total Liabilities|1,599,657K|\n|Book Value|\\~3.2B|\n|Market Cap|3.3B|\n|TTM Operating Income|600Mln|\n|5yr Avg Operating Income|672Mln|\n|P/B|\\~1X|\n|P/OI|\\~5X|\n\nWow. You're getting the company at book value today, and at a 20% income yield. It seems like it's deep value, so what are the growth prospects?\n\n|B2Gold Company Expectations|Gold Ounces|\n|:-|:-|\n|2024|800K|\n|2025|1Mln|\n|2026|1.2Mln|\n\nSo what does this look like as far as their sales expectations? Let's see the price of gold:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00gmixjgnjje1.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2b3030a72eb4b41b4938d400eeac334db5b28fa\n\nCompared to the company's reported all-in-sustaining-cost of producing gold at $1,200 an ounce, the company generates about \\~$1700 an ounce in cash at today's prices. Who said you needed to be a tech stock to get 50%+ margins?\n\nSo, let's take a look at their 2026 projected gold ounces produced vs. some potential prices of gold. Assuming 1.2Mln ounces produced in 2026, here is their operating income:\n\n|Cost of Production / Gold Price|$2000|$2500|$3000|$4000|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$1200\\*|$960Mln|$1560Mln|$2160Mln|**$3360Mln**|\n|$1400|$720Mln|$1320Mln|$1920Mln|$3120Mln|\n|$1600|**$480Mln**|$1080Mln|$1680Mln|$2880Mln|\n\nThe company reports an AISC of $1200, but I've extrapolated this to 1,400 and 1,600 to account for worst case scenarios. Today's gold price is near $3000, but I've shown more bearish moves to $2000 an ounce to show worst case scenarios.\n\nIf you price in a 30% increase in costs and a 30% decline in gold price, the company is still trading at only **\\~6X** their projected operating income.\n\nSo, an incredible margin of safety in the bear case scenario. What about a bull case scenario where costs remain the same but gold increases another 30% from here in 2026? The company will earn **3.3B** in operating income, which is the entire market capitalization. **You are potentially buying this company for 1 Forward P/E.**\n\nThe vast majority of junior gold miners have very similar fundamentals and future growth prospects. The entire industry is priced as if gold is falling +50% from here.\n\nSimilar miners are in the same boat. You don't have to look at gold. Let's take mega miner BHP Group $BHP for a ride. You're getting the company today for 5X 5 year average operating income as well, at 2X book value. Of course upside is more limited with a larger company, but the mineral diversification in BHP means that you benefit from price increases over many minerals.\n\n**PART 4: Little Investor Participation**\n\nTell me this, when's the last time you saw someone shilling mining stocks on WSB? When's the last time a mining stock IPO'd on robinhood, or your friend showed you his mining tendies? There's basically zero investor interest left in the sector. It's tarnished by ESG, political risk, and just not being \"sexy\".\n\nIf you were an active manager following mining over the past 20 years, you lost your job. Why would anyone keep the regard that failed to beat the market for 20+ years?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hl2u5drpjje1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=859518764be92fb4e04cfe5721935682f6d11d2b\n\nThe mining index has plummeted in comparison to its historic market participation. The pessimism is a clear setup for a multi-bagger contrarian play.\n\n**PART 5: Ridiculous Potential**\n\nI've already outlined an example miner for you to see the kinds of valuations present in the sector, but  the Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ) is filled to the brim with similar companies. When you look at a mining  industry's 20 year history on google, the chart looks like shit. But have they ever outperformed?\n\nMining stocks have generally been counter-cyclical: When markets fizzle out, they find their time to boom.\n\nThey surged in the Depression, mooned in the 70s inflation crisis:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxc6j2nhqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c32453a5afd3e8390247fd643c5191303f98714\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4hgv5ckqjje1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43b557c4d3cf05889c6f1a13c96c4ec86e939cd\n\nSpecifically, they are counter-cyclical with Tech, and boomed during the last tech cycle wash in 2000:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5berkqxrqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=b067f3c82ff2fd8fa3d4ff135feec946d5e9f3fa\n\nAnd of course, the prices of the ores they're pulling out of the ground are expected to rise as well. Inflation is ripping the price of gold and looks to stop no time soon.\n\nSteel and iron used for building is ramping up with urbanization and economic prosperity, whereas rare earth metals are finding their space in batteries, EVs, and semiconductors.\n\nCopper is the backbone of electrification, and every single year the world breaks the previous year's record for humans living in urban environments. Global prosperity is the true secular bull market, and metals & mining are deeply connected to global growth in general.\n\nNearly all metals are also hedged to the growth of emerging markets, giving any US investors some necessary global exposure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yyn79l0xujje1.png?width=1129&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a5416495af3dbc9ade3ff9a80a107c34b26eb99\n\n**PART 6: How to Play It**\n\nHere's my takes on the best opportunities in mining:\n\n|Opportunity|Sector|Justification|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Higher Opportunity|Individual small-cap miners ($BTG) \\[Gold, Coal, Iron, Copper, ETC\\]|Diving into individual names helps you avoid exposure to low quality companies in the indexes. Small caps have the best potential to scale earnings parabolically.|\n||Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ)|General exposure to smallcap gold|\n||Individual large-cap miners ($BHP)|While not as sensitive to price movements to the upside, large-caps are less sensitive to downside movements in the underlying commodities, and you can avoid some junk by diving into individual names|\n||Metals & Mining ETFs ($PICK, $COPX)|Exposure beyond gold is great, as many of these miners across different metals have similar valuations and vary in their industry verticals.|\n||Gold Miner ETF ($GDX)|General exposure to largecap gold|\n|Lower Opportunity|Rare Earth Metals ($REMX)|While I think the same thesis is in tact for rare earth metal miners, their valuations trade at a substantial premium to the more \"classical\" miners of gold, silver, coal, iron, copper, nickel etc.|\n\nMy plays:\n\nI'm long the following:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jf9rsqmn0kje1.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a545df7a3687358bb1ec7739aa7adaa855ec34f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvotmymn0kje1.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=a67361da344478392b3d29d7d772a921158c23af\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1g267nn0kje1.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=db76144393fe70db03eed48e64219d606ef975ce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/guzharmn0kje1.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=6589f635566ae9a976248ae3040f67b69c971d9f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjpt8nmn0kje1.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=f877b83eb62dc762d75ab82169e86640c9d0489a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i99qsnmn0kje1.png?width=396&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ca153a9b85e4a477c193bf1a75f8286620179e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77jsapmn0kje1.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=6767ebd76f704fdbf264ae3d3d0e4c59e816ba30\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j72ppsmn0kje1.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=19ef0a371e8aacb273252a340a64f13e849e2ed1\n\nReposting with positions.",

I'm going to attempt to explain to you regards why gold and silver mines print money and critical minerals projects are critically regarded.\n\n**Rare Earths**\n\nRare earths are not rare! The main payable metal is NdPr Neodymium Praseodymium used for magnets. With Neodymium prices in the toilet due to China doing China things like injecting ammonium sulfate directly into the ground to leach the rare earths in situ, most hard rock projects like MP materials are losing money.\n\nThere are some great ionic clay rare earth projects out there with over 2% rare earth oxides but they exist on non freedom exchanges like the TSX and the ASX and are development projects that aren't mining anything yet.\n\nThe key issue with rare earths is processing capacity. This will probably get on-shored to the US in the next 5-10 years and China and Lynas Rare Earths will no longer be the only processors. This is why UUUU is the least regarded investment OP listed. DYODD.\n\n**Lithium**\n\nThere was never a shortage of lithium, only a shortage of lithium processing capacity. Any deposit under 1% lithium is not going to be economic. Lithium is about as rare as copper. Guys at Exxon are developing direct lithium extraction technologies to extract lithium directly out of saltwater wells in [Arkansas](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/1113_exxonmobil-drilling-first-lithium-well-in-arkansas).\n\nIf they figure that out most existing hard rock mines may no longer be economical. Lithium is the most regarded bet. Any decent lithium project worth anything got built in the last few years.\n\n**Gold and Silver**\n\nWe are in the beginning of a precious metals bull market. Any regard can see this in the gold chart. Historically silver prices tend to follow gold prices, but silver moons harder than gold does because the average regard is too poor to buy gold.\n\nGold is what central banks buy when their butt holes start to pucker. And they have been buying gold at record levels recently.\n\nGDX and GDXJ are terrible bets because most gold companies are trash. Barrick was producing 5 million ounces 10 years ago now they're down to 2 million ounces. Nemont did so many acquisitions in the past 20 years ballooning its share count offsetting any kind of rise in profits or production they might have experienced. These companies have ruined the reputation of the mining sector for most institutions and retail investors.\n\nIt's best to bet on mid tier producers that are building or developing new mines.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59zhe7f38rke1.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=64554b0001ea145e64283e67a4a58d4b797a290a\n\nEquinox Gold just reported great earnings as their new flagship gold mine in Canada has reached commercial nameplate capacity. While their new mine is printing money they will make the sustaining capital investments in their other mines that they have put off which will lead to even more baggies.",

        "text": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.  However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I’m going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump’s term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine’s minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn’t much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon’t understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our secretary of state who has recently opened up  negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the supply chain. Here is an article he wrote r[ecently on the matter too](https://thehill.com/opinion/4817683-critical-minerals-crisis-china/).  **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)). Oh and remember that scandal with Boeing having compromised metals in their planes? Yep, that's also because of the supply chain [being decoupled from the west](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40637-how-boeings-counterfeit-titanium-crisis-was-predictable-and-preventable&ved=2ahUKEwj2iYS3y9eLAxVZwvACHU6RKzAQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1vrXeJfqlxo_MfhMITKxyD) and this issue is only going to become a bigger thorn in the side of western interests as time goes on and demand continues to grow.\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Trump Administration, Republican Majorities, Cosmetics, and Converging Interests**\n\nAlright, so we've established that the US is seriously threatened by China’s stranglehold over this sector. Great. So what is this administration and other key players in the industry doing about it? Here are a few points that I find compelling in making the case for the mining industry about to have a massive run.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**TechMet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is TechMet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA (Saudi fund)**. They are also **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in TechMet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of TechMet.\n\nAs if this was not enough, TechMet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors.** Suffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before. \n\nIf you are curious, here is Brian Menell, two or so weeks ago, discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively. \n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions “[Unleashing American Energy”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as  [“Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).”\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to “establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states” as well as “to protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation”\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national  security interests, called the **“Quad.”** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality\\*\\*. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.\\*\\* Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gtl426m18rke1.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46ae72c3552c0d547b0e3c58f81aa77087fdc82\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eohhxem18rke1.jpg?width=695&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bafce8b3889246a92f0536fa56dfb09914c3f8a4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nk10w5m18rke1.jpg?width=662&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a003c565e4c627c8ffdd8f02b82aa4c997fc028\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana, Uber, VST)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**TLOFF** is nickel, partnered with TSLA\n\n>**ABAT** is US lithium batteries supply/recycling\n\n>**Other Ideas:** I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure. There are two or three more investments I intend to make on Monday, which I'll disclose when I decide what they will be. I may also adjust a few things here and there.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>“TechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

        "text": "I want to focus a sector that receives no love: Mining.\n\nTrading at decade-lows with little investor interest, mining stocks today are like tech stocks in 2001. I'm going to show you how they have all the elements of a 10-bagger play, and how you should take advantage of the upcoming bull run\n\n**PART 1: Qualities of a 10-Bagger**\n\nWithout overcomplicating things, a 10-bagger stock or industry can be summarized with these elements:\n\n1. Left For Dead Prices - Prices that don't reflect the baked in value or potential growth of the company, especially compared to historic averages, since prices are typically mean-reverting.\n2. Little Investor Participation - Trades that aren't crowded out by investors, muting potential future gains.\n3. Ridiculous Potential - Massive margins of safety and explosive potential upside that lead to companies consistently growing their top line.\n\n**PART 2: A Tale of Two Sectors**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5aslgqpajje1.jpg?width=1341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5045ac70d14bd4b629332bac9984ad0c845b1829\n\nYou've been a regard for investing in mining over the past \\~30 years. The index rose over \\~5x, and you're flat. Any active manager in Mining stocks has either been fired or full-ported into Apple at this point.\n\nIt's even more stark when you compare to tech. Over the past 30 years, the tech sector delivered \\~5,000% return, dwarfing the broader market’s \\~1,874%.\n\nInvestors have crowded the trade, leading to a situation where you nearly can't avoid exposure to the richly valued tech names:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47riv3obbjje1.jpg?width=1389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e31b8099d02c792cbb737a2f9ee17374f99ef163\n\nSafe to say miners aren't included in any meaningful allocation in today's indexes.\n\nBut do they have the potential to 10x from here?\n\n**PART 3: Left for Dead Prices**\n\nThe most compelling case for a 10-bagger is being cheap. Buying Apple at 10-15 PE in the 2010's is retrospectively a no-brainer. It gives you an incredible margin of safety if you're buying growth for value prices.\n\nMiners are cyclical companies deeply exposed to the price of the ores they mine. Whether it's copper, silver, gold, or rare metals, miners generally scale with the price of their underlying commodity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/670ubnytljje1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=685e17313d2d2d33bed2d39c3733183eced31cba\n\nFor gold miners, this hasn't been the case. Despite gold roaring to highs around $2900 an ounce, the average gold miner is down over the past 20 years.\n\nMany of these miners produce gold for less then $1000 an ounce and have been reinvesting their income into future production. Let's take a look under the hood at B2Gold $BTG\n\n|B2Gold|Metrics|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Assets|4,788,737K|\n|Total Liabilities|1,599,657K|\n|Book Value|\\~3.2B|\n|Market Cap|3.3B|\n|TTM Operating Income|600Mln|\n|5yr Avg Operating Income|672Mln|\n|P/B|\\~1X|\n|P/OI|\\~5X|\n\nWow. You're getting the company at book value today, and at a 20% income yield. It seems like it's deep value, so what are the growth prospects?\n\n|B2Gold Company Expectations|Gold Ounces|\n|:-|:-|\n|2024|800K|\n|2025|1Mln|\n|2026|1.2Mln|\n\nSo what does this look like as far as their sales expectations? Let's see the price of gold:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00gmixjgnjje1.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2b3030a72eb4b41b4938d400eeac334db5b28fa\n\nCompared to the company's reported all-in-sustaining-cost of producing gold at $1,200 an ounce, the company generates about \\~$1700 an ounce in cash at today's prices. Who said you needed to be a tech stock to get 50%+ margins?\n\nSo, let's take a look at their 2026 projected gold ounces produced vs. some potential prices of gold. Assuming 1.2Mln ounces produced in 2026, here is their operating income:\n\n|Cost of Production / Gold Price|$2000|$2500|$3000|$4000|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$1200\\*|$960Mln|$1560Mln|$2160Mln|**$3360Mln**|\n|$1400|$720Mln|$1320Mln|$1920Mln|$3120Mln|\n|$1600|**$480Mln**|$1080Mln|$1680Mln|$2880Mln|\n\nThe company reports an AISC of $1200, but I've extrapolated this to 1,400 and 1,600 to account for worst case scenarios. Today's gold price is near $3000, but I've shown more bearish moves to $2000 an ounce to show worst case scenarios.\n\nIf you price in a 30% increase in costs and a 30% decline in gold price, the company is still trading at only **\\~6X** their projected operating income.\n\nSo, an incredible margin of safety in the bear case scenario. What about a bull case scenario where costs remain the same but gold increases another 30% from here in 2026? The company will earn **3.3B** in operating income, which is the entire market capitalization. **You are potentially buying this company for 1 Forward P/E.**\n\nThe vast majority of junior gold miners have very similar fundamentals and future growth prospects. The entire industry is priced as if gold is falling +50% from here.\n\nSimilar miners are in the same boat. You don't have to look at gold. Let's take mega miner BHP Group $BHP for a ride. You're getting the company today for 5X 5 year average operating income as well, at 2X book value. Of course upside is more limited with a larger company, but the mineral diversification in BHP means that you benefit from price increases over many minerals.\n\n**PART 4: Little Investor Participation**\n\nTell me this, when's the last time you saw someone shilling mining stocks on WSB? When's the last time a mining stock IPO'd on robinhood, or your friend showed you his mining tendies? There's basically zero investor interest left in the sector. It's tarnished by ESG, political risk, and just not being \"sexy\".\n\nIf you were an active manager following mining over the past 20 years, you lost your job. Why would anyone keep the regard that failed to beat the market for 20+ years?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hl2u5drpjje1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=859518764be92fb4e04cfe5721935682f6d11d2b\n\nThe mining index has plummeted in comparison to its historic market participation. The pessimism is a clear setup for a multi-bagger contrarian play.\n\n**PART 5: Ridiculous Potential**\n\nI've already outlined an example miner for you to see the kinds of valuations present in the sector, but  the Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ) is filled to the brim with similar companies. When you look at a mining  industry's 20 year history on google, the chart looks like shit. But have they ever outperformed?\n\nMining stocks have generally been counter-cyclical: When markets fizzle out, they find their time to boom.\n\nThey surged in the Depression, mooned in the 70s inflation crisis:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxc6j2nhqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c32453a5afd3e8390247fd643c5191303f98714\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4hgv5ckqjje1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43b557c4d3cf05889c6f1a13c96c4ec86e939cd\n\nSpecifically, they are counter-cyclical with Tech, and boomed during the last tech cycle wash in 2000:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5berkqxrqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=b067f3c82ff2fd8fa3d4ff135feec946d5e9f3fa\n\nAnd of course, the prices of the ores they're pulling out of the ground are expected to rise as well. Inflation is ripping the price of gold and looks to stop no time soon.\n\nSteel and iron used for building is ramping up with urbanization and economic prosperity, whereas rare earth metals are finding their space in batteries, EVs, and semiconductors.\n\nCopper is the backbone of electrification, and every single year the world breaks the previous year's record for humans living in urban environments. Global prosperity is the true secular bull market, and metals & mining are deeply connected to global growth in general.\n\nNearly all metals are also hedged to the growth of emerging markets, giving any US investors some necessary global exposure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yyn79l0xujje1.png?width=1129&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a5416495af3dbc9ade3ff9a80a107c34b26eb99\n\n**PART 6: How to Play It**\n\nHere's my takes on the best opportunities in mining:\n\n|Opportunity|Sector|Justification|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Higher Opportunity|Individual small-cap miners ($BTG) \\[Gold, Coal, Iron, Copper, ETC\\]|Diving into individual names helps you avoid exposure to low quality companies in the indexes.

        "text": "A few hours ago I saw some regard posting[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/) on the mining industry gassing up regarded metals like lithium and rare earths. I'm going to attempt to explain to you regards why gold and silver mines print money and critical minerals projects are critically regarded.\n\n**Rare Earths**\n\nRare earths are not rare! The main payable metal is NdPr Neodymium Praseodymium used for magnets. With Neodymium prices in the toilet due to China doing China things like injecting ammonium sulfate directly into the ground to leach the rare earths in situ, most hard rock projects like MP materials are losing money.\n\nThere are some great ionic clay rare earth projects out there with over 2% rare earth oxides but they exist on non freedom exchanges like the TSX and the ASX and are development projects that aren't mining anything yet.\n\nThe key issue with rare earths is processing capacity. This will probably get on-shored to the US in the next 5-10 years and China and Lynas Rare Earths will no longer be the only processors. This is why UUUU is the least regarded investment OP listed. DYODD.\n\n**Lithium**\n\nThere was never a shortage of lithium, only a shortage of lithium processing capacity. Any deposit under 1% lithium is not going to be economic. Lithium is about as rare as copper. Guys at Exxon are developing direct lithium extraction technologies to extract lithium directly out of saltwater wells in [Arkansas](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/1113_exxonmobil-drilling-first-lithium-well-in-arkansas).\n\nIf they figure that out most existing hard rock mines may no longer be economical. Lithium is the most regarded bet. Any decent lithium project worth anything got built in the last few years.\n\n**Gold and Silver**\n\nWe are in the beginning of a precious metals bull market. Any regard can see this in the gold chart. Historically silver prices tend to follow gold prices, but silver moons harder than gold does because the average regard is too poor to buy gold.\n\nGold is what central banks buy when their butt holes start to pucker. And they have been buying gold at record levels recently.\n\nGDX and GDXJ are terrible bets because most gold companies are trash. Barrick was producing 5 million ounces 10 years ago now they're down to 2 million ounces. Nemont did so many acquisitions in the past 20 years ballooning its share count offsetting any kind of rise in profits or production they might have experienced. These companies have ruined the reputation of the mining sector for most institutions and retail investors.\n\nIt's best to bet on mid tier producers that are building or developing new mines.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59zhe7f38rke1.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=64554b0001ea145e64283e67a4a58d4b797a290a\n\nEquinox Gold just reported great earnings as their new flagship gold mine in Canada has reached commercial nameplate capacity. While their new mine is printing money they will make the sustaining capital investments in their other mines that they have put off which will lead to even more baggies.",

        "text": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.  However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I’m going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump’s term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine’s minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn’t much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon’t understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our secretary of state who has recently opened up  negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the supply chain. Here is an article he wrote r[ecently on the matter too](https://thehill.com/opinion/4817683-critical-minerals-crisis-china/).  **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)). Oh and remember that scandal with Boeing having compromised metals in their planes? Yep, that's also because of the supply chain [being decoupled from the west](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40637-how-boeings-counterfeit-titanium-crisis-was-predictable-and-preventable&ved=2ahUKEwj2iYS3y9eLAxVZwvACHU6RKzAQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1vrXeJfqlxo_MfhMITKxyD) and this issue is only going to become a bigger thorn in the side of western interests as time goes on and demand continues to grow.\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Trump Administration, Republican Majorities, Cosmetics, and Converging Interests**\n\nAlright, so we've established that the US is seriously threatened by China’s stranglehold over this sector. Great. So what is this administration and other key players in the industry doing about it? Here are a few points that I find compelling in making the case for the mining industry about to have a massive run.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**TechMet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is TechMet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA (Saudi fund)**. They are also **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in TechMet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of TechMet.\n\nAs if this was not enough, TechMet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors.** Suffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before. \n\nIf you are curious, here is Brian Menell, two or so weeks ago, discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively. \n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions “[Unleashing American Energy”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as  [“Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).”\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to “establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states” as well as “to protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation”\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national  security interests, called the **“Quad.”** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality\\*\\*. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.\\*\\* Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gtl426m18rke1.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46ae72c3552c0d547b0e3c58f81aa77087fdc82\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eohhxem18rke1.jpg?width=695&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bafce8b3889246a92f0536fa56dfb09914c3f8a4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nk10w5m18rke1.jpg?width=662&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a003c565e4c627c8ffdd8f02b82aa4c997fc028\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana, Uber, VST)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**TLOFF** is nickel, partnered with TSLA\n\n>**ABAT** is US lithium batteries supply/recycling\n\n>**Other Ideas:** I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure. There are two or three more investments I intend to make on Monday, which I'll disclose when I decide what they will be. I may also adjust a few things here and there.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>“TechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

        "title": "This sector you've never touched is a 10-bagger. [DD]",
        "text": "I want to focus a sector that receives no love: Mining.\n\nTrading at decade-lows with little investor interest, mining stocks today are like tech stocks in 2001. I'm going to show you how they have all the elements of a 10-bagger play, and how you should take advantage of the upcoming bull run\n\n**PART 1: Qualities of a 10-Bagger**\n\nWithout overcomplicating things, a 10-bagger stock or industry can be summarized with these elements:\n\n1. Left For Dead Prices - Prices that don't reflect the baked in value or potential growth of the company, especially compared to historic averages, since prices are typically mean-reverting.\n2. Little Investor Participation - Trades that aren't crowded out by investors, muting potential future gains.\n3. Ridiculous Potential - Massive margins of safety and explosive potential upside that lead to companies consistently growing their top line.\n\n**PART 2: A Tale of Two Sectors**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5aslgqpajje1.jpg?width=1341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5045ac70d14bd4b629332bac9984ad0c845b1829\n\nYou've been a regard for investing in mining over the past \\~30 years. The index rose over \\~5x, and you're flat. Any active manager in Mining stocks has either been fired or full-ported into Apple at this point.\n\nIt's even more stark when you compare to tech. Over the past 30 years, the tech sector delivered \\~5,000% return, dwarfing the broader market’s \\~1,874%.\n\nInvestors have crowded the trade, leading to a situation where you nearly can't avoid exposure to the richly valued tech names:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47riv3obbjje1.jpg?width=1389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e31b8099d02c792cbb737a2f9ee17374f99ef163\n\nSafe to say miners aren't included in any meaningful allocation in today's indexes.\n\nBut do they have the potential to 10x from here?\n\n**PART 3: Left for Dead Prices**\n\nThe most compelling case for a 10-bagger is being cheap. Buying Apple at 10-15 PE in the 2010's is retrospectively a no-brainer. It gives you an incredible margin of safety if you're buying growth for value prices.\n\nMiners are cyclical companies deeply exposed to the price of the ores they mine. Whether it's copper, silver, gold, or rare metals, miners generally scale with the price of their underlying commodity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/670ubnytljje1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=685e17313d2d2d33bed2d39c3733183eced31cba\n\nFor gold miners, this hasn't been the case. Despite gold roaring to highs around $2900 an ounce, the average gold miner is down over the past 20 years.\n\nMany of these miners produce gold for less then $1000 an ounce and have been reinvesting their income into future production. Let's take a look under the hood at B2Gold $BTG\n\n|B2Gold|Metrics|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Assets|4,788,737K|\n|Total Liabilities|1,599,657K|\n|Book Value|\\~3.2B|\n|Market Cap|3.3B|\n|TTM Operating Income|600Mln|\n|5yr Avg Operating Income|672Mln|\n|P/B|\\~1X|\n|P/OI|\\~5X|\n\nWow. You're getting the company at book value today, and at a 20% income yield. It seems like it's deep value, so what are the growth prospects?\n\n|B2Gold Company Expectations|Gold Ounces|\n|:-|:-|\n|2024|800K|\n|2025|1Mln|\n|2026|1.2Mln|\n\nSo what does this look like as far as their sales expectations? Let's see the price of gold:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00gmixjgnjje1.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2b3030a72eb4b41b4938d400eeac334db5b28fa\n\nCompared to the company's reported all-in-sustaining-cost of producing gold at $1,200 an ounce, the company generates about \\~$1700 an ounce in cash at today's prices. Who said you needed to be a tech stock to get 50%+ margins?\n\nSo, let's take a look at their 2026 projected gold ounces produced vs. some potential prices of gold. Assuming 1.2Mln ounces produced in 2026, here is their operating income:\n\n|Cost of Production / Gold Price|$2000|$2500|$3000|$4000|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$1200\\*|$960Mln|$1560Mln|$2160Mln|**$3360Mln**|\n|$1400|$720Mln|$1320Mln|$1920Mln|$3120Mln|\n|$1600|**$480Mln**|$1080Mln|$1680Mln|$2880Mln|\n\nThe company reports an AISC of $1200, but I've extrapolated this to 1,400 and 1,600 to account for worst case scenarios. Today's gold price is near $3000, but I've shown more bearish moves to $2000 an ounce to show worst case scenarios.\n\nIf you price in a 30% increase in costs and a 30% decline in gold price, the company is still trading at only **\\~6X** their projected operating income.\n\nSo, an incredible margin of safety in the bear case scenario. What about a bull case scenario where costs remain the same but gold increases another 30% from here in 2026? The company will earn **3.3B** in operating income, which is the entire market capitalization. **You are potentially buying this company for 1 Forward P/E.**\n\nThe vast majority of junior gold miners have very similar fundamentals and future growth prospects. The entire industry is priced as if gold is falling +50% from here.\n\nSimilar miners are in the same boat. You don't have to look at gold. Let's take mega miner BHP Group $BHP for a ride. You're getting the company today for 5X 5 year average operating income as well, at 2X book value. Of course upside is more limited with a larger company, but the mineral diversification in BHP means that you benefit from price increases over many minerals.\n\n**PART 4: Little Investor Participation**\n\nTell me this, when's the last time you saw someone shilling mining stocks on WSB? When's the last time a mining stock IPO'd on robinhood, or your friend showed you his mining tendies? There's basically zero investor interest left in the sector. It's tarnished by ESG, political risk, and just not being \"sexy\".\n\nIf you were an active manager following mining over the past 20 years, you lost your job. Why would anyone keep the regard that failed to beat the market for 20+ years?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hl2u5drpjje1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=859518764be92fb4e04cfe5721935682f6d11d2b\n\nThe mining index has plummeted in comparison to its historic market participation. The pessimism is a clear setup for a multi-bagger contrarian play.\n\n**PART 5: Ridiculous Potential**\n\nI've already outlined an example miner for you to see the kinds of valuations present in the sector, but  the Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ) is filled to the brim with similar companies. When you look at a mining  industry's 20 year history on google, the chart looks like shit. But have they ever outperformed?\n\nMining stocks have generally been counter-cyclical: When markets fizzle out, they find their time to boom.\n\nThey surged in the Depression, mooned in the 70s inflation crisis:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxc6j2nhqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c32453a5afd3e8390247fd643c5191303f98714\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4hgv5ckqjje1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43b557c4d3cf05889c6f1a13c96c4ec86e939cd\n\nSpecifically, they are counter-cyclical with Tech, and boomed during the last tech cycle wash in 2000:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5berkqxrqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=b067f3c82ff2fd8fa3d4ff135feec946d5e9f3fa\n\nAnd of course, the prices of the ores they're pulling out of the ground are expected to rise as well. Inflation is ripping the price of gold and looks to stop no time soon.\n\nSteel and iron used for building is ramping up with urbanization and economic prosperity, whereas rare earth metals are finding their space in batteries, EVs, and semiconductors.\n\nCopper is the backbone of electrification, and every single year the world breaks the previous year's record for humans living in urban environments. Global prosperity is the true secular bull market, and metals & mining are deeply connected to global growth in general.\n\nNearly all metals are also hedged to the growth of emerging markets, giving any US investors some necessary global exposure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yyn79l0xujje1.png?width=1129&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a5416495af3dbc9ade3ff9a80a107c34b26eb99\n\n**PART 6: How to Play It**\n\nHere's my takes on the best opportunities in mining:\n\n|Opportunity|Sector|Justification|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Higher Opportunity|Individual small-cap miners ($BTG) \\[Gold, Coal, Iron, Copper, ETC\\]|Diving into individual names helps you avoid exposure to low quality companies in the indexes. Small caps have the best potential to scale earnings parabolically.|\n||Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ)|General exposure to smallcap gold|\n||Individual large-cap miners ($BHP)|While not as sensitive to price movements to the upside, large-caps are less sensitive to downside movements in the underlying commodities, and you can avoid some junk by diving into individual names|\n||Metals & Mining ETFs ($PICK, $COPX)|Exposure beyond gold is great, as many of these miners across different metals have similar valuations and vary in their industry verticals.|\n||Gold Miner ETF ($GDX)|General exposure to largecap gold|\n|Lower Opportunity|Rare Earth Metals ($REMX)|While I think the same thesis is in tact for rare earth metal miners, their valuations trade at a substantial premium to the more \"classical\" miners of gold, silver, coal, iron, copper, nickel etc.|\n\nMy plays:\n\nI'm long the following:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jf9rsqmn0kje1.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a545df7a3687358bb1ec7739aa7adaa855ec34f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvotmymn0kje1.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=a67361da344478392b3d29d7d772a921158c23af\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1g267nn0kje1.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=db76144393fe70db03eed48e64219d606ef975ce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/guzharmn0kje1.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=6589f635566ae9a976248ae3040f67b69c971d9f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjpt8nmn0kje1.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=f877b83eb62dc762d75ab82169e86640c9d0489a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i99qsnmn0kje1.png?width=396&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ca153a9b85e4a477c193bf1a75f8286620179e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77jsapmn0kje1.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=6767ebd76f704fdbf264ae3d3d0e4c59e816ba30\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j72ppsmn0kje1.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=19ef0a371e8aacb273252a340a64f13e849e2ed1\n\nReposting with positions.",

        "text": "Anyone following IBKR over the last year knows that their line goes pretty consistently up. I have made money before by buying ITM options on IBKR dips, so I entered again on Thursday. Was 2k in profit before Friday's mini meltdown but I carried on buying most of the way down. Now it looks like I have a YOLO on my hands.\n\nMy rationale is as follows:\n\nIBKR is a good broker, and is taking over from RH as the regards' broker of choice. You don't even have to get in your car or risk getting a restraining order for stalking a cashier (in true WSB style) to find this out. Just count the number of IBKR screenshots posted on here. They used to be rare, now they're very common. \n\nAs well as an increasing number of customers, they make money from commissions, margin loans to degenerates, and paying Fed rate minus .5% to those enjoying a fleeting moment of glory and holding their fat stacks with them. Commissions and margin loans basically means they make money from volatility. This was reiterated in their last earnings report.\n\nSell everything and go all cash when you see Elon's offspring using the Oval Office as a playpen? IBKR makes money. Cash out US stocks to buy EU defence stocks in a patriotic fervour? IBKR makes money. Go all in with margin on TQQQ calls when the President calls off his own tariff war? IBKR makes money.\n\nThey publish monthly metrics so you don't need to wait for earnings for confirmation they are doing well. In January they did well. Metrics for this month will be out early March and I can't imagine they will be bad.\n\nThis should get back in the mid 230s before long. IV is relatively low, so I'm holding 15 x 210C for next month's expiry. If this is the beginning of a market downtrend I'm fucked, but I suppose that goes for most of us.\n\nTl;dr - IBKR is a good broker, is growing anyway, and does especially well in periods of volatility. IBKR's numbers wull be fine, but downside risk is that if SPY keeps drilling I'm gonna get gaped.\n\n",

        "text": "A few hours ago I saw some regard posting[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/) on the mining industry gassing up regarded metals like lithium and rare earths. I'm going to attempt to explain to you regards why gold and silver mines print money and critical minerals projects are critically regarded.\n\n**Rare Earths**\n\nRare earths are not rare! The main payable metal is NdPr Neodymium Praseodymium used for magnets. With Neodymium prices in the toilet due to China doing China things like injecting ammonium sulfate directly into the ground to leach the rare earths in situ, most hard rock projects like MP materials are losing money.\n\nThere are some great ionic clay rare earth projects out there with over 2% rare earth oxides but they exist on non freedom exchanges like the TSX and the ASX and are development projects that aren't mining anything yet.\n\nThe key issue with rare earths is processing capacity. This will probably get on-shored to the US in the next 5-10 years and China and Lynas Rare Earths will no longer be the only processors. This is why UUUU is the least regarded investment OP listed. DYODD.\n\n**Lithium**\n\nThere was never a shortage of lithium, only a shortage of lithium processing capacity. Any deposit under 1% lithium is not going to be economic. Lithium is about as rare as copper. Guys at Exxon are developing direct lithium extraction technologies to extract lithium directly out of saltwater wells in [Arkansas](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/1113_exxonmobil-drilling-first-lithium-well-in-arkansas).\n\nIf they figure that out most existing hard rock mines may no longer be economical. Lithium is the most regarded bet. Any decent lithium project worth anything got built in the last few years.\n\n**Gold and Silver**\n\nWe are in the beginning of a precious metals bull market. Any regard can see this in the gold chart. Historically silver prices tend to follow gold prices, but silver moons harder than gold does because the average regard is too poor to buy gold.\n\nGold is what central banks buy when their butt holes start to pucker. And they have been buying gold at record levels recently.\n\nGDX and GDXJ are terrible bets because most gold companies are trash. Barrick was producing 5 million ounces 10 years ago now they're down to 2 million ounces. Nemont did so many acquisitions in the past 20 years ballooning its share count offsetting any kind of rise in profits or production they might have experienced. These companies have ruined the reputation of the mining sector for most institutions and retail investors.\n\nIt's best to bet on mid tier producers that are building or developing new mines.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59zhe7f38rke1.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=64554b0001ea145e64283e67a4a58d4b797a290a\n\nEquinox Gold just reported great earnings as their new flagship gold mine in Canada has reached commercial nameplate capacity. While their new mine is printing money they will make the sustaining capital investments in their other mines that they have put off which will lead to even more baggies.",

        "text": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.  However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I’m going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump’s term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine’s minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn’t much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon’t understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our secretary of state who has recently opened up  negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the supply chain. Here is an article he wrote r[ecently on the matter too](https://thehill.com/opinion/4817683-critical-minerals-crisis-china/).  **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)). Oh and remember that scandal with Boeing having compromised metals in their planes? Yep, that's also because of the supply chain [being decoupled from the west](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40637-how-boeings-counterfeit-titanium-crisis-was-predictable-and-preventable&ved=2ahUKEwj2iYS3y9eLAxVZwvACHU6RKzAQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1vrXeJfqlxo_MfhMITKxyD) and this issue is only going to become a bigger thorn in the side of western interests as time goes on and demand continues to grow.\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Trump Administration, Republican Majorities, Cosmetics, and Converging Interests**\n\nAlright, so we've established that the US is seriously threatened by China’s stranglehold over this sector. Great. So what is this administration and other key players in the industry doing about it? Here are a few points that I find compelling in making the case for the mining industry about to have a massive run.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**TechMet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is TechMet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA (Saudi fund)**. They are also **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in TechMet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of TechMet.\n\nAs if this was not enough, TechMet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors.** Suffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before. \n\nIf you are curious, here is Brian Menell, two or so weeks ago, discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively. \n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions “[Unleashing American Energy”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as  [“Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).”\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to “establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states” as well as “to protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation”\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national  security interests, called the **“Quad.”** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality\\*\\*. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.\\*\\* Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gtl426m18rke1.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46ae72c3552c0d547b0e3c58f81aa77087fdc82\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eohhxem18rke1.jpg?width=695&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bafce8b3889246a92f0536fa56dfb09914c3f8a4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nk10w5m18rke1.jpg?width=662&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a003c565e4c627c8ffdd8f02b82aa4c997fc028\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana, Uber, VST)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**TLOFF** is nickel, partnered with TSLA\n\n>**ABAT** is US lithium batteries supply/recycling\n\n>**Other Ideas:** I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure. There are two or three more investments I intend to make on Monday, which I'll disclose when I decide what they will be. I may also adjust a few things here and there.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>“TechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

I’ll keep this short and sweet so that we can all continue celebrating Denzel’s birthday.\n\nSome of you may remember me from that one time I told everyone about an impending alien invasion, but the CIA caught wind of it and launched a huge disinformation campaign here on WSB.

        "title": "This sector you've never touched is a 10-bagger. [DD]",
        "text": "I want to focus a sector that receives no love: Mining.\n\nTrading at decade-lows with little investor interest, mining stocks today are like tech stocks in 2001. I'm going to show you how they have all the elements of a 10-bagger play, and how you should take advantage of the upcoming bull run\n\n**PART 1: Qualities of a 10-Bagger**\n\nWithout overcomplicating things, a 10-bagger stock or industry can be summarized with these elements:\n\n1. Left For Dead Prices - Prices that don't reflect the baked in value or potential growth of the company, especially compared to historic averages, since prices are typically mean-reverting.\n2. Little Investor Participation - Trades that aren't crowded out by investors, muting potential future gains.\n3. Ridiculous Potential - Massive margins of safety and explosive potential upside that lead to companies consistently growing their top line.\n\n**PART 2: A Tale of Two Sectors**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5aslgqpajje1.jpg?width=1341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5045ac70d14bd4b629332bac9984ad0c845b1829\n\nYou've been a regard for investing in mining over the past \\~30 years. The index rose over \\~5x, and you're flat. Any active manager in Mining stocks has either been fired or full-ported into Apple at this point.\n\nIt's even more stark when you compare to tech. Over the past 30 years, the tech sector delivered \\~5,000% return, dwarfing the broader market’s \\~1,874%.\n\nInvestors have crowded the trade, leading to a situation where you nearly can't avoid exposure to the richly valued tech names:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47riv3obbjje1.jpg?width=1389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e31b8099d02c792cbb737a2f9ee17374f99ef163\n\nSafe to say miners aren't included in any meaningful allocation in today's indexes.\n\nBut do they have the potential to 10x from here?\n\n**PART 3: Left for Dead Prices**\n\nThe most compelling case for a 10-bagger is being cheap. Buying Apple at 10-15 PE in the 2010's is retrospectively a no-brainer. It gives you an incredible margin of safety if you're buying growth for value prices.\n\nMiners are cyclical companies deeply exposed to the price of the ores they mine. Whether it's copper, silver, gold, or rare metals, miners generally scale with the price of their underlying commodity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/670ubnytljje1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=685e17313d2d2d33bed2d39c3733183eced31cba\n\nFor gold miners, this hasn't been the case. Despite gold roaring to highs around $2900 an ounce, the average gold miner is down over the past 20 years.\n\nMany of these miners produce gold for less then $1000 an ounce and have been reinvesting their income into future production. Let's take a look under the hood at B2Gold $BTG\n\n|B2Gold|Metrics|\n|:-|:-|\n|Total Assets|4,788,737K|\n|Total Liabilities|1,599,657K|\n|Book Value|\\~3.2B|\n|Market Cap|3.3B|\n|TTM Operating Income|600Mln|\n|5yr Avg Operating Income|672Mln|\n|P/B|\\~1X|\n|P/OI|\\~5X|\n\nWow. You're getting the company at book value today, and at a 20% income yield. It seems like it's deep value, so what are the growth prospects?\n\n|B2Gold Company Expectations|Gold Ounces|\n|:-|:-|\n|2024|800K|\n|2025|1Mln|\n|2026|1.2Mln|\n\nSo what does this look like as far as their sales expectations? Let's see the price of gold:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00gmixjgnjje1.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2b3030a72eb4b41b4938d400eeac334db5b28fa\n\nCompared to the company's reported all-in-sustaining-cost of producing gold at $1,200 an ounce, the company generates about \\~$1700 an ounce in cash at today's prices. Who said you needed to be a tech stock to get 50%+ margins?\n\nSo, let's take a look at their 2026 projected gold ounces produced vs. some potential prices of gold. Assuming 1.2Mln ounces produced in 2026, here is their operating income:\n\n|Cost of Production / Gold Price|$2000|$2500|$3000|$4000|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$1200\\*|$960Mln|$1560Mln|$2160Mln|**$3360Mln**|\n|$1400|$720Mln|$1320Mln|$1920Mln|$3120Mln|\n|$1600|**$480Mln**|$1080Mln|$1680Mln|$2880Mln|\n\nThe company reports an AISC of $1200, but I've extrapolated this to 1,400 and 1,600 to account for worst case scenarios. Today's gold price is near $3000, but I've shown more bearish moves to $2000 an ounce to show worst case scenarios.\n\nIf you price in a 30% increase in costs and a 30% decline in gold price, the company is still trading at only **\\~6X** their projected operating income.\n\nSo, an incredible margin of safety in the bear case scenario. What about a bull case scenario where costs remain the same but gold increases another 30% from here in 2026? The company will earn **3.3B** in operating income, which is the entire market capitalization. **You are potentially buying this company for 1 Forward P/E.**\n\nThe vast majority of junior gold miners have very similar fundamentals and future growth prospects. The entire industry is priced as if gold is falling +50% from here.\n\nSimilar miners are in the same boat. You don't have to look at gold. Let's take mega miner BHP Group $BHP for a ride. You're getting the company today for 5X 5 year average operating income as well, at 2X book value. Of course upside is more limited with a larger company, but the mineral diversification in BHP means that you benefit from price increases over many minerals.\n\n**PART 4: Little Investor Participation**\n\nTell me this, when's the last time you saw someone shilling mining stocks on WSB? When's the last time a mining stock IPO'd on robinhood, or your friend showed you his mining tendies? There's basically zero investor interest left in the sector. It's tarnished by ESG, political risk, and just not being \"sexy\".\n\nIf you were an active manager following mining over the past 20 years, you lost your job. Why would anyone keep the regard that failed to beat the market for 20+ years?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hl2u5drpjje1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=859518764be92fb4e04cfe5721935682f6d11d2b\n\nThe mining index has plummeted in comparison to its historic market participation. The pessimism is a clear setup for a multi-bagger contrarian play.\n\n**PART 5: Ridiculous Potential**\n\nI've already outlined an example miner for you to see the kinds of valuations present in the sector, but  the Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ) is filled to the brim with similar companies. When you look at a mining  industry's 20 year history on google, the chart looks like shit. But have they ever outperformed?\n\nMining stocks have generally been counter-cyclical: When markets fizzle out, they find their time to boom.\n\nThey surged in the Depression, mooned in the 70s inflation crisis:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxc6j2nhqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c32453a5afd3e8390247fd643c5191303f98714\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4hgv5ckqjje1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43b557c4d3cf05889c6f1a13c96c4ec86e939cd\n\nSpecifically, they are counter-cyclical with Tech, and boomed during the last tech cycle wash in 2000:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5berkqxrqjje1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=b067f3c82ff2fd8fa3d4ff135feec946d5e9f3fa\n\nAnd of course, the prices of the ores they're pulling out of the ground are expected to rise as well. Inflation is ripping the price of gold and looks to stop no time soon.\n\nSteel and iron used for building is ramping up with urbanization and economic prosperity, whereas rare earth metals are finding their space in batteries, EVs, and semiconductors.\n\nCopper is the backbone of electrification, and every single year the world breaks the previous year's record for humans living in urban environments. Global prosperity is the true secular bull market, and metals & mining are deeply connected to global growth in general.\n\nNearly all metals are also hedged to the growth of emerging markets, giving any US investors some necessary global exposure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yyn79l0xujje1.png?width=1129&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a5416495af3dbc9ade3ff9a80a107c34b26eb99\n\n**PART 6: How to Play It**\n\nHere's my takes on the best opportunities in mining:\n\n|Opportunity|Sector|Justification|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Higher Opportunity|Individual small-cap miners ($BTG) \\[Gold, Coal, Iron, Copper, ETC\\]|Diving into individual names helps you avoid exposure to low quality companies in the indexes. Small caps have the best potential to scale earnings parabolically.|\n||Junior Miner Index ($GDXJ)|General exposure to smallcap gold|\n||Individual large-cap miners ($BHP)|While not as sensitive to price movements to the upside, large-caps are less sensitive to downside movements in the underlying commodities, and you can avoid some junk by diving into individual names|\n||Metals & Mining ETFs ($PICK, $COPX)|Exposure beyond gold is great, as many of these miners across different metals have similar valuations and vary in their industry verticals.|\n||Gold Miner ETF ($GDX)|General exposure to largecap gold|\n|Lower Opportunity|Rare Earth Metals ($REMX)|While I think the same thesis is in tact for rare earth metal miners, their valuations trade at a substantial premium to the more \"classical\" miners of gold, silver, coal, iron, copper, nickel etc.|\n\nMy plays:\n\nI'm long the following:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jf9rsqmn0kje1.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a545df7a3687358bb1ec7739aa7adaa855ec34f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvotmymn0kje1.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=a67361da344478392b3d29d7d772a921158c23af\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1g267nn0kje1.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=db76144393fe70db03eed48e64219d606ef975ce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/guzharmn0kje1.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=6589f635566ae9a976248ae3040f67b69c971d9f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjpt8nmn0kje1.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=f877b83eb62dc762d75ab82169e86640c9d0489a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i99qsnmn0kje1.png?width=396&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ca153a9b85e4a477c193bf1a75f8286620179e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77jsapmn0kje1.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=6767ebd76f704fdbf264ae3d3d0e4c59e816ba30\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j72ppsmn0kje1.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=19ef0a371e8aacb273252a340a64f13e849e2ed1\n\nReposting with positions.",
