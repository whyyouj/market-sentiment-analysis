The Energy contribution was particularly strong, offset somewhat by lower precious metal deliveries. Total GEOs are on track to meet annual guidance. Our NSR and stream interests are inflation-proof and our G&A expenses are less than 3% of revenue. This allows revenue growth to translate directly into expanded earnings. Franco-Nevada is debt-free and is growing its cash balances. Our recent Asset Handbook highlighted good resource growth at our assets and we have a strong pipeline of precious metal opportunities.\"",

GEO sales growth was driven by an increased contribution from Cobre Panama, outperformance by Antamina and contributions from new acquisitions. The advantage of our diverse portfolio was again demonstrated in 2021. High iron ore prices during the year boosted revenues from our iron ore holdings and rising energy prices resulted in our energy revenues more than doubling. Following 2021's rapid GEO growth, we expect slightly lower GEOs in 2022 and then to continue our growth through 2026. With limited exposure to inflation, our top-line growth translated directly into expanded margins and record earnings. Franco-Nevada is debt-free, is growing its cash balances and has a strong pipeline of growth opportunities.\"",
