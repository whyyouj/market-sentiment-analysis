( \"Invert\" )  focused on developing a greener future for the Curipamba project and its stakeholders in central Ecuador  ( \"Curipamba\" ) . Globally and not just in the Americas, Curipamba is one of the highest grade and lowest capital intensity copper-gold projects and is also expected to have lowest-quartile greenhouse gas  ( \"GHG\" )  emissions intensity during future operations. The project's carbon footprint is expected to directly benefit from the planned connection to the national power grid, which is already 80% supplied by hydro-electric sources, and proximity to deep water ports. Adventus Mining and Salazar seek to build upon these strengths by developing a robust decarbonization roadmap and climate change policy from active project to future operations.",

However, while this has put a minor dent in short-term momentum, key ratios continue to point to higher prices ahead for the metal. If we combine this with the silver's bullish posture on its long-term chart and the position of real rates, I see several reasons to be bullish over the next year. Let's take a closer look below:",
